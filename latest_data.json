            "abstract": "Echocardiography is the most widely used cardiac imaging modality, capturing ultrasound video data to assess cardiac structure and function1. Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

We benchmark CellWhisperer’s performance for zero-shot prediction of cell types and other biological annotations and demonstrate its use for biological discovery in a meta-analysis of human embryonic development. We integrate a CellWhisperer chat box with the CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore gene expression through a combined graphical and chat interface.

However, current approaches require sharing the covariance matrix between variants for each study and trait of interest. For large-scale studies with many phenotypes, these matrices can be cumbersome to calculate, store and share. Here, to address this challenge, we present REMETA—an efficient tool for meta-analysis of gene-based tests. REMETA uses a single sparse covariance reference file per study that is rescaled for each phenotype using single-variant summary statistics. We develop new methods for binary traits with case–control imbalance, and to estimate allele frequencies, genotype counts and effect sizes of burden tests. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our approach through meta-analysis of five traits in 469,376 samples in UK Biobank. The open-source REMETA software will facilitate meta-analysis across large-scale exome sequencing studies from diverse studies that cannot easily be combined.

Deep learning has revolutionized two-dimensional (2D) cell segmentation, enabling generalized solutions across cell types and imaging modalities.

However, three-dimensional (3D) cell segmentation, requiring dense annotation of 2D slices, still poses substantial challenges. Manual labeling of 3D cells to train broadly applicable segmentation models is prohibitive. Even in high-contrast images annotation is ambiguous and time-consuming. Here we develop a theory and toolbox, u-Segment3D, for 2D-to-3D segmentation, compatible with any 2D method generating pixel-based instance cell masks. u-Segment3D translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data, as demonstrated on 11 real-life datasets, comprising &gt;70,000 cells, spanning single cells, cell aggregates and tissue. Moreover, u-Segment3D is competitive with native 3D segmentation, even exceeding when cells are crowded and have complex morphologies. u-Segment3D is a universal framework that translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data.

            "abstract": "The development of effective interventions for neurodegenerative disorders, such as posterior cortical atrophy (a visual Alzheimer’s variant), remains to be a significant clinical challenge. We introduce a computational framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as in silico models to simulate visual system degeneration and evaluate intervention strategies. By modeling controlled synaptic decay and comparing three distinct retraining approaches, random data (control), accuracy-based, and entropy-based, we assess impacts on classification performance and neural representation geometry. Our results demonstrate that accuracy-based retraining outperformed other strategies, maintaining model performance and preserving optimal manifold geometry during intermediate degeneration stages. This computational analysis supports prioritizing accuracy-targeted interventions for cognitive compensation. Our framework enables rapid evaluation of intervention efficacy while elucidating computational principles underlying neurodegeneration and recovery. This approach offers a platform for refining strategies to slow visual-cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, bridging mechanistic insights with clinical translation.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells maintain homeostasis of their outer membrane by controlled internalization of lipid and protein constituents via endocytosis. Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and uses similarly folded domains. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes, however, differs between eukaryotic kingdoms. The TPLATE complex (TPC) in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several protein domains with a conserved role in endocytosis into a single octameric protein complex. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation and requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPC of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane-binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences. Finally, we demonstrate via molecular dynamics simulations that the crescent shape of the structured part of the complex is sufficient for membrane curvature generation. Our mechanistic insight, obtained by a combined biochemical and computational approach, shows that the structured part of the TPC likely contributes to the execution of plant endocytosis, which does not depend on cytoskeletal-based force generation. The manuscript uses an integrative approach to generate a comprehensive structure of the multisubunit endocytic TPLATE complex and to study its membrane targeting and its role in membrane deformation during the initial phase of plant endocytosis.",

Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

However, clonal contribution of HSCs has only been investigated at single time points and without assessing the critical erythroid and platelet lineages. Here we screened for somatic mutations in healthy aged individuals, identifying expanded HSC clones accessible for lineage tracing of all major blood cell lineages. In addition to HSC clones with balanced contribution to all lineages, we identified clones with all myeloid lineages but no or few B and T lymphocytes or all myeloid lineages and B cells but no T cells. No other lineage restriction patterns were reproducibly observed. Retrospective phylogenetic inferences uncovered a ‘hierarchical’ pattern of descendant subclones more lineage biased than their ancestral clone and a more common ‘stable’ pattern with descendant subclones showing highly concordant lineage contributions with their ancestral clone, despite decades of separation. Prospective lineage tracing confirmed remarkable stability over years of HSC clones with distinct lineage replenishment patterns. This study uses somatic mutations as a natural barcoding system to retrospectively and prospectively trace the fate of hematopoietic stem cells across all major blood cell lineages in healthy aged individuals. It reveals the existence of intrinsically fate-biased hematopoietic stem cells in native human hematopoiesis, validated by transplantation assays.",

We developed a hydraulically controlled curvature array chip recapitulating disease-relevant geometries (33-56D) to investigate how keratocytes, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts respond to geometric stress. Curvature-induced mechanical stress triggered dramatic cellular remodeling keratocytes exhibited significant proliferative enhancement and phenotypic transformation with ALDH3A1 downregulation and α-SMA upregulation, indicating mechanobiologically driven fibrotic activation. Fibroblasts developed curvature-dependent orthogonal alignment that recapitulates native corneal lamellar organization without chemical cues, while myofibroblasts showed enhanced contractile responses. RNA sequencing revealed that geometric stress activates identical molecular pathways dysregulated in keratoconus, including TGF-β/SMAD signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, and inflammatory cascades. Extracellular matrix remodeling was cell-type specific, with keratocytes showing homeostatic control loss, fibroblasts promoting matrix deposition, and myofibroblasts driving degradation. These findings establish curvature-induced mechanotransduction as the fundamental driver of corneal ectatic disease progression, repositioning geometric stress from a passive consequence to an active determinant of pathology. Kim and colleagues propose a curvature-controlled organ chip array to monitor how geometric stress drives corneal disease progression. The authors show that geometric stress triggers cellular changes that replicate keratoconus pathology and they identify dysregulated molecular pathways for potential therapeutic approaches.",

We introduce a computational framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as in silico models to simulate visual system degeneration and evaluate intervention strategies. By modeling controlled synaptic decay and comparing three distinct retraining approaches, random data (control), accuracy-based, and entropy-based, we assess impacts on classification performance and neural representation geometry. Our results demonstrate that accuracy-based retraining outperformed other strategies, maintaining model performance and preserving optimal manifold geometry during intermediate degeneration stages. This computational analysis supports prioritizing accuracy-targeted interventions for cognitive compensation. Our framework enables rapid evaluation of intervention efficacy while elucidating computational principles underlying neurodegeneration and recovery. This approach offers a platform for refining strategies to slow visual-cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, bridging mechanistic insights with clinical translation.",

Although methods to enantioselectively assemble consecutive carbon stereocenters are abundant, courses to establish enriched continuous heteroatomic stereocenters have acquired less attention and remain a tremendous challenge. Of those atoms in main group elements, nitrogen and boron are the most intractable ones to control their chirality. The copper-catalyzed asymmetric insertion reaction is one of the most significant transformations to construct C-B bonds in organic synthesis. Herein, we report a protocol to synthesize troublesome continuous heteroatomic stereocenters from cyclic amine boranes and diazo compounds via asymmetric B-H insertion reaction. The protocol is compatible with a wide range of amine boranes and diazo compounds, exhibiting high diastereo- and enantioselectivities. Mechanistic studies reveal a meaningful kinetic resolution pathway involved in the transformation and DFT calculations elucidate the origins of stereoselectivity and diastereoselectivity.

Here, we show that π-stacking of heteroaromatic tri-pyridine molecules with a 1,3,5-triazine core (H-TriPy) enhances molecular conjugation, significantly augments NIR absorption, and enables dual-band modulation with improved visual comfort. The three pyridine-based redox centers facilitate multi-step electron transfer, enabling multi-modal EC regulation, including bright, cool, and dark modes. Incorporation of a fluorinated ionic liquid into EC organogels inhibits irreversible π-stacking of high-concentration H-TriPy. Consequently, H-TriPy-based EC devices achieve neutral-colored states with near-zero transmittance as low as 3.7% in both visible and NIR ranges and maintain high switching stability of over 89.1% retention after 100,000 cycles. Furthermore, large-area EC devices exhibit uniform tinting and reliable stability, underscoring their potential for energy-efficient green buildings. Electrochromic materials have been used in thermal management systems though it is challenging due to limited NIR and long-term instability.

            "abstract": "Titanium alloys represent a promising material in marine applications, focusing on high-stakes environments where their corrosion resistance and high specific strength offer significant benefits. However, they can still be vulnerable to localized corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, in the presence of aggressive chlorides. Here we report a lightweight titanium alloy that addresses these issues through conventional casting and thermal-mechanical processing. The alloy can generate a passive film showing distinct but stable electrochemical responses. It is found that the reaction of the passive film can shift from the slow accumulation in the passive region, to the rapid buildup of passive layers in extreme anodic potentials. Consequently, the alloy exhibits a pitting potential above 10 VSCE without being subjected to localized corrosion. Meanwhile, mechanical reliability is also achieved during stress corrosion tests, owing to the fast repair of the passive film that substantially constrains the crack propagation. Such virtual immunity to seawater corrosion qualifies this titanium alloy as a potential candidate for long-term cost savings and sustainability. Seawater corrosion can impact the lifespan and reliability of metallic materials for marine applications. This work develops a titanium alloy exhibiting active passivation behavior that ensures its electrochemical and mechanical stability in seawater-like environments.",

The expression of virulence gene families varied in trypomastigotes after each round of cell infection, resulting in heterogeneous parasite populations with variable cell invasion capacity. A T. cruzi genome-wide yeast surface display screen against Chagas disease patients’ antibodies reveals genes expressed during human infections. However, limited conservation in their antibody-binding sites suggests their sequence diversity and variation might help parasites avert antibody recognition. The data point to a role for some multigene families in infection persistence. The authors assembled a high-resolution genome of Trypanosoma cruzi and, integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, and patient antibody responses, uncovered that this pathogen uses antigenic variation, suggesting strategies of infection persistence.",

In response, phages use anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade CRISPR immunity. The few type III Acrs identified so far show conditional effectiveness in countering type III immunity or rely on unknown or poorly understood inhibitory mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of AcrIIIA2, a type III-A Acr encoded by Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Biochemical and structural analyses reveal that phage AcrIIIA2 co-opts host enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to form a ternary complex with the S. thermophilus type III-A (Csm) CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complex, obstructing its immune responses. The enolase-chaperoned AcrIIIA2 blocks the initial step of phage RNA binding, thereby preventing downstream type III anti-phage immune responses. Enolase participates in the anti-immune response by serving as an essential structural scaffold, stabilizing Acr–CRISPR interactions. These findings uncover a new anti-defence strategy that exploits a well-conserved host factor to block CRISPR immunity. Streptococcus thermophilus phages circumvent host CRISPR defences via AcrIIIA2, which complexes with enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to block phage RNA binding.",

Here we show that m6A-methylated self U6 snRNA is recognized by YTHDF2 to reduce its stability and prevent its binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), leading to decreased inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells and mouse models. At the molecular level, endosomal U6 snRNA binds to the LRR21 domain in TLR3, independent of m6A methylation, to activate inflammatory gene expression, a mechanism that is distinct from that of the best known synthetic TLR3 agonist poly I:C. Both U6 snRNA and YTHDF2 are localized to endosomes via the transmembrane protein SIDT2, where YTHDF2 functions to prevent the U6-TLR3 interaction. We further show that UVB exposure inhibits YTHDF2 by inducing its dephosphorylation and autophagic protein degradation in human keratinocytes and mouse skin. Skin-specific deletion of Ythdf2 in mice enhanced the UVB-induced skin inflammatory response and promoted tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that YTHDF2 plays a crucial role in controlling inflammation by inhibiting m6A U6-mediated TLR3 activation, suggesting that YTHDF2 and m6A U6 are potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating inflammation and tumorigenesis.

Mutations in these genes are implicated in genetic diseases and cancer. Here we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogues of SAMD9/9L in the antibacteriophage defence system, Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease site was conserved in bacterial analogues and was essential for cell death, suggesting a fundamental role in defence across different life kingdoms. Despite this shared immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimpanzee and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions compared with the human orthologue. These SAMD9/9L adaptations probably resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Evolutionary characterization of Avs9 and SAMD9/9L provides a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viruses over billions of years of evolution. A search for analogues of the human SAMD9/9L antiviral genes identifies convergent evolution of this gene family in the bacterial and animal kingdoms, with species-specific and recent genomic signatures indicative of adaptations resulting from evolutionary arms races with viruses.",

Feeding increases TSLP and induces ILC2 type 2 cytokines that are attenuated by deletion of TSLP in fibroblasts or TSLP receptor on ILC2s. Both mouse and human intestinal fibroblasts express receptors for glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2)—an intestinotrophic growth factor released by enteroendocrine cells following food intake. GLP-2 promotes intestinal TSLP in mouse and human intestinal fibroblasts, and TSLP-dependent ILC2 activation and tuft cell hyperplasia in mice, thus linking nutrient detection with ILC2-mediated amplification of the tuft cell chemosensory circuit that promotes epithelial surveillance of ingested cargo.

Here we used a suite of single-cell approaches, including integrated live-cell imaging of secretion and cell fate, flow cytometry and high-content imaging, to investigate IL-1β secretion dynamics in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes. We found marked heterogeneity: a large fraction of cells remained viable and contributed negligibly to IL-1β secretion, challenging established models. Instead, a small subset (5–10%) undergoing canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis produced the majority of secreted IL-1β, with a smaller contribution from apoptotic cells transitioning to secondary necrosis. Single-cell profiling of CD14+ monocytes from patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome confirmed lytic cell death as the driver of pathological IL-1β release. These findings redefine IL-1β as a damage-associated molecular pattern, secreted predominantly by dying monocytes.

In response, phages use anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade CRISPR immunity. The few type III Acrs identified so far show conditional effectiveness in countering type III immunity or rely on unknown or poorly understood inhibitory mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of AcrIIIA2, a type III-A Acr encoded by Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Biochemical and structural analyses reveal that phage AcrIIIA2 co-opts host enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to form a ternary complex with the S. thermophilus type III-A (Csm) CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complex, obstructing its immune responses. The enolase-chaperoned AcrIIIA2 blocks the initial step of phage RNA binding, thereby preventing downstream type III anti-phage immune responses. Enolase participates in the anti-immune response by serving as an essential structural scaffold, stabilizing Acr–CRISPR interactions. These findings uncover a new anti-defence strategy that exploits a well-conserved host factor to block CRISPR immunity. Streptococcus thermophilus phages circumvent host CRISPR defences via AcrIIIA2, which complexes with enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to block phage RNA binding.",

However, current approaches require sharing the covariance matrix between variants for each study and trait of interest. For large-scale studies with many phenotypes, these matrices can be cumbersome to calculate, store and share. Here, to address this challenge, we present REMETA—an efficient tool for meta-analysis of gene-based tests. REMETA uses a single sparse covariance reference file per study that is rescaled for each phenotype using single-variant summary statistics. We develop new methods for binary traits with case–control imbalance, and to estimate allele frequencies, genotype counts and effect sizes of burden tests. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our approach through meta-analysis of five traits in 469,376 samples in UK Biobank. The open-source REMETA software will facilitate meta-analysis across large-scale exome sequencing studies from diverse studies that cannot easily be combined.

However, clonal contribution of HSCs has only been investigated at single time points and without assessing the critical erythroid and platelet lineages. Here we screened for somatic mutations in healthy aged individuals, identifying expanded HSC clones accessible for lineage tracing of all major blood cell lineages. In addition to HSC clones with balanced contribution to all lineages, we identified clones with all myeloid lineages but no or few B and T lymphocytes or all myeloid lineages and B cells but no T cells. No other lineage restriction patterns were reproducibly observed. Retrospective phylogenetic inferences uncovered a ‘hierarchical’ pattern of descendant subclones more lineage biased than their ancestral clone and a more common ‘stable’ pattern with descendant subclones showing highly concordant lineage contributions with their ancestral clone, despite decades of separation. Prospective lineage tracing confirmed remarkable stability over years of HSC clones with distinct lineage replenishment patterns. This study uses somatic mutations as a natural barcoding system to retrospectively and prospectively trace the fate of hematopoietic stem cells across all major blood cell lineages in healthy aged individuals.

The genome provides accurate organization of multigene family genes, confirming their distribution in expanded clusters or scattered throughout the chromosomes. Quantitative proteomics shows stage-specific proteins and numerous trans-sialidases upregulated in trypomastigotes. The expression of virulence gene families varied in trypomastigotes after each round of cell infection, resulting in heterogeneous parasite populations with variable cell invasion capacity. A T. cruzi genome-wide yeast surface display screen against Chagas disease patients’ antibodies reveals genes expressed during human infections. However, limited conservation in their antibody-binding sites suggests their sequence diversity and variation might help parasites avert antibody recognition.

Here we show that m6A-methylated self U6 snRNA is recognized by YTHDF2 to reduce its stability and prevent its binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), leading to decreased inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells and mouse models. At the molecular level, endosomal U6 snRNA binds to the LRR21 domain in TLR3, independent of m6A methylation, to activate inflammatory gene expression, a mechanism that is distinct from that of the best known synthetic TLR3 agonist poly I:C. Both U6 snRNA and YTHDF2 are localized to endosomes via the transmembrane protein SIDT2, where YTHDF2 functions to prevent the U6-TLR3 interaction. We further show that UVB exposure inhibits YTHDF2 by inducing its dephosphorylation and autophagic protein degradation in human keratinocytes and mouse skin. Skin-specific deletion of Ythdf2 in mice enhanced the UVB-induced skin inflammatory response and promoted tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that YTHDF2 plays a crucial role in controlling inflammation by inhibiting m6A U6-mediated TLR3 activation, suggesting that YTHDF2 and m6A U6 are potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating inflammation and tumorigenesis. RNA modifications influence gene regulation and disease.

Mutations in these genes are implicated in genetic diseases and cancer. Here we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogues of SAMD9/9L in the antibacteriophage defence system, Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease site was conserved in bacterial analogues and was essential for cell death, suggesting a fundamental role in defence across different life kingdoms. Despite this shared immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimpanzee and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions compared with the human orthologue. These SAMD9/9L adaptations probably resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Evolutionary characterization of Avs9 and SAMD9/9L provides a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viruses over billions of years of evolution. A search for analogues of the human SAMD9/9L antiviral genes identifies convergent evolution of this gene family in the bacterial and animal kingdoms, with species-specific and recent genomic signatures indicative of adaptations resulting from evolutionary arms races with viruses.",

            "abstract": "In mammals, DNA methylation is re-established after implantation following post-fertilization global erasure. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we investigate H3K36me2 reprogramming in mouse early development and its role in post-implantation DNA methylation re-establishment. In oocytes, H3K36me2 accumulates in gene bodies upon transcription silencing and partially persists to the eight-cell stage. De novo H3K36me2 occurs at enhancers after zygotic genome activation, before spreading genome-wide after implantation, except on the inactive X chromosome. Mutation of the H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1 compromises global DNA methylation after implantation preferentially in extra-embryonic lineages and that at methylation-prone promoters, including those of germline-specific genes. However, DNA methylation establishment partially bypasses H3K36me2 through upregulated DNMT3B, a ‘leaky’ H3K36me2/3 reader. This contrasts with DNMT3A, which strictly requires H3K36me2/3 for DNA methylation through its PWWP domain. Finally, DNA methylation valleys escape de novo DNA methylation via PRC1/H2AK119ub1-mediated H3K36me2 exclusion. Thus, H3K36me2 reprogramming regulates lineage- and locus-specific post-implantation DNA methylation establishment. Lu, Wang et al. profile H3K36me2 throughout oocyte-to-embryo transition, pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and report a role for H3K36me2 in post-implantation embryos to re-establish lineage-specific DNA methylation.",

However, their transport mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate the structural and functional basis of human solute carrier family 37 member 2 (SLC37A2), a G6P transporter implicated in metabolic regulation and macrophage inflammation. We show that SLC37A2 functions as a uniporter, facilitating G6P transport independent of inorganic phosphate gradients. Structures of SLC37A2 in the apo and G6P-bound states reveal a dimeric architecture. Both the ER luminal-open and cytosolic-open structures are captured, showing the structural dynamics during G6P transport. G6P is coordinated by SLC37A2 through interactions with its phosphate and hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, mapping mutations associated with glycogen storage disease type Ib onto SLC37A2 highlights residues essential for transport activity. Together, this work provides structural insights into G6P transport and establishes a framework for understanding related metabolic disorders.

Here we show that m6A-methylated self U6 snRNA is recognized by YTHDF2 to reduce its stability and prevent its binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), leading to decreased inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells and mouse models. At the molecular level, endosomal U6 snRNA binds to the LRR21 domain in TLR3, independent of m6A methylation, to activate inflammatory gene expression, a mechanism that is distinct from that of the best known synthetic TLR3 agonist poly I:C. Both U6 snRNA and YTHDF2 are localized to endosomes via the transmembrane protein SIDT2, where YTHDF2 functions to prevent the U6-TLR3 interaction. We further show that UVB exposure inhibits YTHDF2 by inducing its dephosphorylation and autophagic protein degradation in human keratinocytes and mouse skin. Skin-specific deletion of Ythdf2 in mice enhanced the UVB-induced skin inflammatory response and promoted tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that YTHDF2 plays a crucial role in controlling inflammation by inhibiting m6A U6-mediated TLR3 activation, suggesting that YTHDF2 and m6A U6 are potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating inflammation and tumorigenesis.

Calcimembrin/C16orf74 (CLMB), an intrinsically disordered microprotein whose expression correlates with poor cancer outcomes, targets calcineurin to membranes where it may promote oncogenesis by shaping calcineurin signaling. We show that CLMB associates with membranes via lipidation, i.e., N-myristoylation and reversible S-acylation. Furthermore, CLMB contains an unusual composite ‘LxVPxIxIT’ motif, that binds the PxIxIT-docking site on calcineurin with extraordinarily high affinity when phosphorylated, 33LDVPDIIITPP(p)T44. Calcineurin dephosphorylates CLMB to decrease this affinity, but Thr44 is protected from dephosphorylation when PxIxIT-bound. We propose that CLMB is dephosphorylated in multimeric complexes, where one PxIxIT-bound CLMB recruits calcineurin to membranes, allowing a second CLMB to engage via its LxVP motif to be dephosphorylated. In vivo and in vitro data, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of CLMB-calcineurin complexes, support this model. Thus, CLMB with its composite motif imposes distinct properties to calcineurin signaling at membranes including sensitivity to CLMB:calcineurin ratios, CLMB phosphorylation and dynamic S-acylation. C16orf74/ calcimembrin (CLMB), a lipidated microprotein with roles in cancer, targets the calcineurin phosphatase to membranes. Here, authors show how CLMB uses a composite motif to form multimeric complexes with calcineurin that are required for dephosphorylation.",

The three pyridine-based redox centers facilitate multi-step electron transfer, enabling multi-modal EC regulation, including bright, cool, and dark modes. Incorporation of a fluorinated ionic liquid into EC organogels inhibits irreversible π-stacking of high-concentration H-TriPy. Consequently, H-TriPy-based EC devices achieve neutral-colored states with near-zero transmittance as low as 3.7% in both visible and NIR ranges and maintain high switching stability of over 89.1% retention after 100,000 cycles. Furthermore, large-area EC devices exhibit uniform tinting and reliable stability, underscoring their potential for energy-efficient green buildings.

However, they can still be vulnerable to localized corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, in the presence of aggressive chlorides. Here we report a lightweight titanium alloy that addresses these issues through conventional casting and thermal-mechanical processing. The alloy can generate a passive film showing distinct but stable electrochemical responses. It is found that the reaction of the passive film can shift from the slow accumulation in the passive region, to the rapid buildup of passive layers in extreme anodic potentials. Consequently, the alloy exhibits a pitting potential above 10 VSCE without being subjected to localized corrosion. Meanwhile, mechanical reliability is also achieved during stress corrosion tests, owing to the fast repair of the passive film that substantially constrains the crack propagation. Such virtual immunity to seawater corrosion qualifies this titanium alloy as a potential candidate for long-term cost savings and sustainability. Seawater corrosion can impact the lifespan and reliability of metallic materials for marine applications. This work develops a titanium alloy exhibiting active passivation behavior that ensures its electrochemical and mechanical stability in seawater-like environments.",

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells maintain homeostasis of their outer membrane by controlled internalization of lipid and protein constituents via endocytosis. Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and uses similarly folded domains. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes, however, differs between eukaryotic kingdoms. The TPLATE complex (TPC) in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several protein domains with a conserved role in endocytosis into a single octameric protein complex. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation and requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPC of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane-binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences. Finally, we demonstrate via molecular dynamics simulations that the crescent shape of the structured part of the complex is sufficient for membrane curvature generation. Our mechanistic insight, obtained by a combined biochemical and computational approach, shows that the structured part of the TPC likely contributes to the execution of plant endocytosis, which does not depend on cytoskeletal-based force generation. The manuscript uses an integrative approach to generate a comprehensive structure of the multisubunit endocytic TPLATE complex and to study its membrane targeting and its role in membrane deformation during the initial phase of plant endocytosis.",

Despite its central role in glycogen metabolism and immune regulation, the structural mechanisms governing SLC37A4’s transport cycle and pathological dysfunction remain elusive. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SLC37A4 in four functional states, capturing conformational transitions between lumen-facing and cytoplasm-facing states. Combined with mutational analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we identify a conserved substrate-binding pocket that alternately accommodates G6P and Pi through electrostatic complementarity and domain-dependent interactions. We further demonstrate that the high-affinity inhibitor S-4048 sterically occludes the cytoplasmic entry pathway by trapping the transporter in a cytoplasm-facing conformation. Our work elucidates the molecular pathology of GSD-Ib-linked mutations and provides a structural framework for developing therapies targeting this transporter in metabolic diseases.

We show that SLC37A2 functions as a uniporter, facilitating G6P transport independent of inorganic phosphate gradients. Structures of SLC37A2 in the apo and G6P-bound states reveal a dimeric architecture. Both the ER luminal-open and cytosolic-open structures are captured, showing the structural dynamics during G6P transport. G6P is coordinated by SLC37A2 through interactions with its phosphate and hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, mapping mutations associated with glycogen storage disease type Ib onto SLC37A2 highlights residues essential for transport activity. Together, this work provides structural insights into G6P transport and establishes a framework for understanding related metabolic disorders.

We developed a hydraulically controlled curvature array chip recapitulating disease-relevant geometries (33-56D) to investigate how keratocytes, fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts respond to geometric stress. Curvature-induced mechanical stress triggered dramatic cellular remodeling keratocytes exhibited significant proliferative enhancement and phenotypic transformation with ALDH3A1 downregulation and α-SMA upregulation, indicating mechanobiologically driven fibrotic activation. Fibroblasts developed curvature-dependent orthogonal alignment that recapitulates native corneal lamellar organization without chemical cues, while myofibroblasts showed enhanced contractile responses. RNA sequencing revealed that geometric stress activates identical molecular pathways dysregulated in keratoconus, including TGF-β/SMAD signaling, ECM-receptor interactions, and inflammatory cascades. Extracellular matrix remodeling was cell-type specific, with keratocytes showing homeostatic control loss, fibroblasts promoting matrix deposition, and myofibroblasts driving degradation. These findings establish curvature-induced mechanotransduction as the fundamental driver of corneal ectatic disease progression, repositioning geometric stress from a passive consequence to an active determinant of pathology. Kim and colleagues propose a curvature-controlled organ chip array to monitor how geometric stress drives corneal disease progression. The authors show that geometric stress triggers cellular changes that replicate keratoconus pathology and they identify dysregulated molecular pathways for potential therapeutic approaches.",

We introduce a computational framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as in silico models to simulate visual system degeneration and evaluate intervention strategies. By modeling controlled synaptic decay and comparing three distinct retraining approaches, random data (control), accuracy-based, and entropy-based, we assess impacts on classification performance and neural representation geometry. Our results demonstrate that accuracy-based retraining outperformed other strategies, maintaining model performance and preserving optimal manifold geometry during intermediate degeneration stages. This computational analysis supports prioritizing accuracy-targeted interventions for cognitive compensation. Our framework enables rapid evaluation of intervention efficacy while elucidating computational principles underlying neurodegeneration and recovery. This approach offers a platform for refining strategies to slow visual-cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, bridging mechanistic insights with clinical translation.",

We benchmark CellWhisperer’s performance for zero-shot prediction of cell types and other biological annotations and demonstrate its use for biological discovery in a meta-analysis of human embryonic development. We integrate a CellWhisperer chat box with the CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore gene expression through a combined graphical and chat interface.

Here we used a suite of single-cell approaches, including integrated live-cell imaging of secretion and cell fate, flow cytometry and high-content imaging, to investigate IL-1β secretion dynamics in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes. We found marked heterogeneity: a large fraction of cells remained viable and contributed negligibly to IL-1β secretion, challenging established models. Instead, a small subset (5–10%) undergoing canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis produced the majority of secreted IL-1β, with a smaller contribution from apoptotic cells transitioning to secondary necrosis. Single-cell profiling of CD14+ monocytes from patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome confirmed lytic cell death as the driver of pathological IL-1β release. These findings redefine IL-1β as a damage-associated molecular pattern, secreted predominantly by dying monocytes. Lamkanfi, Shirasaki, Izawa and colleagues show that IL-1β release in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or carrying NLRP3 activatory mutations is mostly restricted to cells undergoing lytic cell death.",

Deep learning has revolutionized two-dimensional (2D) cell segmentation, enabling generalized solutions across cell types and imaging modalities. This has been driven by the ease of scaling up image acquisition, annotation and computation. However, three-dimensional (3D) cell segmentation, requiring dense annotation of 2D slices, still poses substantial challenges. Manual labeling of 3D cells to train broadly applicable segmentation models is prohibitive. Even in high-contrast images annotation is ambiguous and time-consuming. Here we develop a theory and toolbox, u-Segment3D, for 2D-to-3D segmentation, compatible with any 2D method generating pixel-based instance cell masks. u-Segment3D translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data, as demonstrated on 11 real-life datasets, comprising &gt;70,000 cells, spanning single cells, cell aggregates and tissue. Moreover, u-Segment3D is competitive with native 3D segmentation, even exceeding when cells are crowded and have complex morphologies. u-Segment3D is a universal framework that translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data. It performs well across diverse datasets, including cells with complex morphologies.",

Here, we present CellWhisperer, an artificial intelligence (AI) model and software tool for chat-based interrogation of gene expression. We establish a multimodal embedding of transcriptomes and their textual annotations, using contrastive learning on 1 million RNA sequencing profiles with AI-curated descriptions. This embedding informs a large language model that answers user-provided questions about cells and genes in natural-language chats. We benchmark CellWhisperer’s performance for zero-shot prediction of cell types and other biological annotations and demonstrate its use for biological discovery in a meta-analysis of human embryonic development. We integrate a CellWhisperer chat box with the CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore gene expression through a combined graphical and chat interface. In summary, CellWhisperer leverages large community-scale data repositories to connect transcriptomes and text, thereby enabling interactive exploration of single-cell RNA-sequencing data with natural-language chats.

            "abstract": "In mammals, DNA methylation is re-established after implantation following post-fertilization global erasure. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we investigate H3K36me2 reprogramming in mouse early development and its role in post-implantation DNA methylation re-establishment. In oocytes, H3K36me2 accumulates in gene bodies upon transcription silencing and partially persists to the eight-cell stage. De novo H3K36me2 occurs at enhancers after zygotic genome activation, before spreading genome-wide after implantation, except on the inactive X chromosome. Mutation of the H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1 compromises global DNA methylation after implantation preferentially in extra-embryonic lineages and that at methylation-prone promoters, including those of germline-specific genes. However, DNA methylation establishment partially bypasses H3K36me2 through upregulated DNMT3B, a ‘leaky’ H3K36me2/3 reader. This contrasts with DNMT3A, which strictly requires H3K36me2/3 for DNA methylation through its PWWP domain. Finally, DNA methylation valleys escape de novo DNA methylation via PRC1/H2AK119ub1-mediated H3K36me2 exclusion. Thus, H3K36me2 reprogramming regulates lineage- and locus-specific post-implantation DNA methylation establishment. Lu, Wang et al. profile H3K36me2 throughout oocyte-to-embryo transition, pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and report a role for H3K36me2 in post-implantation embryos to re-establish lineage-specific DNA methylation.",

Here we design libraries of extant, ancestral, mutagenized or miniaturized variants of polymerase III promoters and guide RNA (gRNA) scaffolds and quantify their abilities to mediate precise edits to the mammalian genome through multiplex prime editing. We identify thousands of parts for reproducible editing in human and mouse cell lines, including hundreds with greater activity than commonly used sequences. Saturation mutagenesis screens identify tolerated sequence variants that further enhance sequence diversity. In an application to molecular recording, we design a ‘ten key’ array that, in mammalian cells, achieves balanced activity of pegRNAs as predicted by the activity of the component parts. The data reported here will aid the design of synthetic loci encoding arrays of gRNAs exhibiting predictable, differentiated levels of activity for applications in multiplexed perturbation, biological recorders and complex genetic circuits. Prime editing in mammalian cells benefits from a comprehensive list of genetic parts.",

In addition to HSC clones with balanced contribution to all lineages, we identified clones with all myeloid lineages but no or few B and T lymphocytes or all myeloid lineages and B cells but no T cells. No other lineage restriction patterns were reproducibly observed. Retrospective phylogenetic inferences uncovered a ‘hierarchical’ pattern of descendant subclones more lineage biased than their ancestral clone and a more common ‘stable’ pattern with descendant subclones showing highly concordant lineage contributions with their ancestral clone, despite decades of separation.

This Review examines organoid generation methods, applications in preclinical drug discovery, and the regulatory and practical challenges that must be addressed for their integration into development pipelines.",

Despite its central role in glycogen metabolism and immune regulation, the structural mechanisms governing SLC37A4’s transport cycle and pathological dysfunction remain elusive. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SLC37A4 in four functional states, capturing conformational transitions between lumen-facing and cytoplasm-facing states. Combined with mutational analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we identify a conserved substrate-binding pocket that alternately accommodates G6P and Pi through electrostatic complementarity and domain-dependent interactions. We further demonstrate that the high-affinity inhibitor S-4048 sterically occludes the cytoplasmic entry pathway by trapping the transporter in a cytoplasm-facing conformation. Our work elucidates the molecular pathology of GSD-Ib-linked mutations and provides a structural framework for developing therapies targeting this transporter in metabolic diseases.

Their male pregnancy is facilitated by an evolutionary novel organ—the brood pouch that functions analogously to the mammalian uterus and placenta despite originating from entirely different tissues. Here we use comparative single-cell multiomics and genomics analyses to investigate the transition from egg laying to pregnancy during syngnathid evolution and compare the convergently evolved life history of placental parental care with that in mammals. In vivo experiments show that a population of epithelial progenitors that possesses pouch-inducing potential and expresses androgen, not female hormones as in other live-bearers, can trigger pouch ontogeny. Two mechanisms ensure functionality of the pouch: recruitment of pseudo-placenta-related cells characterized by expressed orthologous genes also found in mammalian uteri and co-option of specific cells for sticky eggs attached to specialized skin patches of males that express novel seahorse-specific genes such as pastns and syn-lectins. These mechanisms combined drove pouch diversity and complexity in syngnathids. Seahorses have a unique sex role reversal with male pregnancy involving the brood pouch, an evolutionarily novel organ.

Mutations in these genes are implicated in genetic diseases and cancer. Here we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogues of SAMD9/9L in the antibacteriophage defence system, Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease site was conserved in bacterial analogues and was essential for cell death, suggesting a fundamental role in defence across different life kingdoms. Despite this shared immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimpanzee and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions compared with the human orthologue. These SAMD9/9L adaptations probably resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Evolutionary characterization of Avs9 and SAMD9/9L provides a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viruses over billions of years of evolution. A search for analogues of the human SAMD9/9L antiviral genes identifies convergent evolution of this gene family in the bacterial and animal kingdoms, with species-specific and recent genomic signatures indicative of adaptations resulting from evolutionary arms races with viruses.",

Here we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)—a cytokine implicated in ILC2 activation—is expressed constitutively in subepithelial fibroblasts, including telocytes and crypt-associated trophocytes, which are specialized fibroblasts necessary to sustain epithelial identity. Feeding increases TSLP and induces ILC2 type 2 cytokines that are attenuated by deletion of TSLP in fibroblasts or TSLP receptor on ILC2s. Both mouse and human intestinal fibroblasts express receptors for glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2)—an intestinotrophic growth factor released by enteroendocrine cells following food intake. GLP-2 promotes intestinal TSLP in mouse and human intestinal fibroblasts, and TSLP-dependent ILC2 activation and tuft cell hyperplasia in mice, thus linking nutrient detection with ILC2-mediated amplification of the tuft cell chemosensory circuit that promotes epithelial surveillance of ingested cargo. Locksley and colleagues describe a nutrient-sensing circuit in the small intestine.

Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SLC37A4 in four functional states, capturing conformational transitions between lumen-facing and cytoplasm-facing states. Combined with mutational analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we identify a conserved substrate-binding pocket that alternately accommodates G6P and Pi through electrostatic complementarity and domain-dependent interactions. We further demonstrate that the high-affinity inhibitor S-4048 sterically occludes the cytoplasmic entry pathway by trapping the transporter in a cytoplasm-facing conformation.

However, manually tracking the locomotor behavior of large numbers of C. elegans is both cumbersome and inefficient. To address the above challenges, we innovatively propose an automated approach for analyzing C. elegans behavior through deep learning-based detection and tracking. Building upon existing research, we developed an enhanced worm detection framework that integrates YOLOv8 with ByteTrack, enabling real-time, precise tracking of multiple worms. Based on the tracking results, we further established an automated high-throughput method for quantitative analysis of multiple movement parameters, including locomotion velocity, body bending angle, and roll frequency, thereby laying a robust foundation for high-precision, automated analysis of complex worm behaviors. including movement speed, body bending angle, and roll frequency, thereby laying a robust foundation for high-precision, automated analysis of complex worm behaviors. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed enhanced C. elegans detection framework outperforms existing methods, achieving a precision of 99.5%, recall of 98.7%, and mAP50 of 99.6%, with a processing speed of 153 frames per second (FPS).

            "abstract": "As a well-established and extensively utilized model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) serves as a crucial platform for investigating behavioral regulation mechanisms and their biological significance. However, manually tracking the locomotor behavior of large numbers of C. elegans is both cumbersome and inefficient. To address the above challenges, we innovatively propose an automated approach for analyzing C. elegans behavior through deep learning-based detection and tracking. Building upon existing research, we developed an enhanced worm detection framework that integrates YOLOv8 with ByteTrack, enabling real-time, precise tracking of multiple worms. Based on the tracking results, we further established an automated high-throughput method for quantitative analysis of multiple movement parameters, including locomotion velocity, body bending angle, and roll frequency, thereby laying a robust foundation for high-precision, automated analysis of complex worm behaviors. including movement speed, body bending angle, and roll frequency, thereby laying a robust foundation for high-precision, automated analysis of complex worm behaviors. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed enhanced C. elegans detection framework outperforms existing methods, achieving a precision of 99.5%, recall of 98.7%, and mAP50 of 99.6%, with a processing speed of 153 frames per second (FPS).

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells maintain homeostasis of their outer membrane by controlled internalization of lipid and protein constituents via endocytosis. Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and uses similarly folded domains. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes, however, differs between eukaryotic kingdoms. The TPLATE complex (TPC) in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several protein domains with a conserved role in endocytosis into a single octameric protein complex. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation and requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPC of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane-binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences. Finally, we demonstrate via molecular dynamics simulations that the crescent shape of the structured part of the complex is sufficient for membrane curvature generation. Our mechanistic insight, obtained by a combined biochemical and computational approach, shows that the structured part of the TPC likely contributes to the execution of plant endocytosis, which does not depend on cytoskeletal-based force generation. The manuscript uses an integrative approach to generate a comprehensive structure of the multisubunit endocytic TPLATE complex and to study its membrane targeting and its role in membrane deformation during the initial phase of plant endocytosis.",
