            "abstract": "Echocardiography is the most widely used cardiac imaging modality, capturing ultrasound video data to assess cardiac structure and function1. Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

We benchmark CellWhisperer’s performance for zero-shot prediction of cell types and other biological annotations and demonstrate its use for biological discovery in a meta-analysis of human embryonic development. We integrate a CellWhisperer chat box with the CELLxGENE browser, allowing users to interactively explore gene expression through a combined graphical and chat interface.

Deep learning has revolutionized two-dimensional (2D) cell segmentation, enabling generalized solutions across cell types and imaging modalities. This has been driven by the ease of scaling up image acquisition, annotation and computation. However, three-dimensional (3D) cell segmentation, requiring dense annotation of 2D slices, still poses substantial challenges. Manual labeling of 3D cells to train broadly applicable segmentation models is prohibitive. Even in high-contrast images annotation is ambiguous and time-consuming. Here we develop a theory and toolbox, u-Segment3D, for 2D-to-3D segmentation, compatible with any 2D method generating pixel-based instance cell masks. u-Segment3D translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data, as demonstrated on 11 real-life datasets, comprising &gt;70,000 cells, spanning single cells, cell aggregates and tissue. Moreover, u-Segment3D is competitive with native 3D segmentation, even exceeding when cells are crowded and have complex morphologies. u-Segment3D is a universal framework that translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data.

Our results demonstrate that accuracy-based retraining outperformed other strategies, maintaining model performance and preserving optimal manifold geometry during intermediate degeneration stages. This computational analysis supports prioritizing accuracy-targeted interventions for cognitive compensation. Our framework enables rapid evaluation of intervention efficacy while elucidating computational principles underlying neurodegeneration and recovery. This approach offers a platform for refining strategies to slow visual-cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, bridging mechanistic insights with clinical translation.",

We demonstrate both in silico and in vivo how improv enables efficient experimental designs for discovery and validation across various model organisms and data types. We used improv to orchestrate real-time behavioral analyses, rapid functional typing of neural responses via calcium imaging, optimal visual stimulus selection, and model-driven optogenetic photostimulation of visually responsive neurons in the zebrafish brain.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in echocardiography has the potential to streamline manual tasks and improve reproducibility and precision2. However, most echocardiography AI models are single-view, single-task systems that do not synthesize complementary information from multiple views captured during a full exam3,4, and thus lead to limited performance and scope of applications. To address this problem, we introduce EchoPrime, a multi-view, view-informed, video-based vision-language foundation model trained on over 12 million video-report pairs. EchoPrime uses contrastive learning to train a unified embedding model for all standard views in a comprehensive echocardiogram study with representation of both rare and common diseases and diagnoses. EchoPrime then utilizes view-classification and a view-informed anatomic attention module to weight video-specific embeddings that accurately map the relationship between echocardiographic views and anatomical structures. With retrieval-augmented interpretation, EchoPrime integrates information from all echocardiogram videos in a comprehensive study and performs holistic clinical interpretation. In datasets from five international independent healthcare systems, EchoPrime achieves state-of-the art performance on 23 diverse benchmarks of cardiac form and function, surpassing the performance of both task-specific approaches and prior foundation models. Following rigorous clinical evaluation, EchoPrime can assist physicians in the automated preliminary assessment of comprehensive echocardiography.",

Here we used a suite of single-cell approaches, including integrated live-cell imaging of secretion and cell fate, flow cytometry and high-content imaging, to investigate IL-1β secretion dynamics in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes. We found marked heterogeneity: a large fraction of cells remained viable and contributed negligibly to IL-1β secretion, challenging established models. Instead, a small subset (5–10%) undergoing canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis produced the majority of secreted IL-1β, with a smaller contribution from apoptotic cells transitioning to secondary necrosis. Single-cell profiling of CD14+ monocytes from patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome confirmed lytic cell death as the driver of pathological IL-1β release. These findings redefine IL-1β as a damage-associated molecular pattern, secreted predominantly by dying monocytes. Lamkanfi, Shirasaki, Izawa and colleagues show that IL-1β release in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or carrying NLRP3 activatory mutations is mostly restricted to cells undergoing lytic cell death.",

We introduce a computational framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as in silico models to simulate visual system degeneration and evaluate intervention strategies. By modeling controlled synaptic decay and comparing three distinct retraining approaches, random data (control), accuracy-based, and entropy-based, we assess impacts on classification performance and neural representation geometry. Our results demonstrate that accuracy-based retraining outperformed other strategies, maintaining model performance and preserving optimal manifold geometry during intermediate degeneration stages. This computational analysis supports prioritizing accuracy-targeted interventions for cognitive compensation. Our framework enables rapid evaluation of intervention efficacy while elucidating computational principles underlying neurodegeneration and recovery. This approach offers a platform for refining strategies to slow visual-cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases, bridging mechanistic insights with clinical translation.",

In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2. These findings represent a significant advancement in achieving high-performance and multicolor LEDs through the stacking of perovskite LEDs.",

Nonetheless, effectively regulating the behavior of solid-state polymers using CO2 remains a considerable challenge, highlighting the need for robust and reliable strategies to address this issue. This study presents elastomers that feature nanophase-separated morphologies composed of CO2-vitrifiable polyethyleneimine and CO2-permeable polydimethylsiloxane components. The elastomers (Young’s modulus (E) of approximately 1 MPa) reversibly transform into hard plastics (E &gt; 2 GPa) in the presence of CO2. In addition to bulk stiffening, their surface adhesion and friction rapidly shift, and the material’s fluorescence is significantly amplified. Here, we show that these multifunctional responses to CO2 position the materials as innovative platforms for responsive mechanical systems and CO2-activated optical devices, with potential applications in sensing, display, and data storage technologies.

            "abstract": "CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) systems provide powerful adaptive immunity against phage infection. In response, phages use anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade CRISPR immunity. The few type III Acrs identified so far show conditional effectiveness in countering type III immunity or rely on unknown or poorly understood inhibitory mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of AcrIIIA2, a type III-A Acr encoded by Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Biochemical and structural analyses reveal that phage AcrIIIA2 co-opts host enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to form a ternary complex with the S. thermophilus type III-A (Csm) CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complex, obstructing its immune responses. The enolase-chaperoned AcrIIIA2 blocks the initial step of phage RNA binding, thereby preventing downstream type III anti-phage immune responses. Enolase participates in the anti-immune response by serving as an essential structural scaffold, stabilizing Acr–CRISPR interactions. These findings uncover a new anti-defence strategy that exploits a well-conserved host factor to block CRISPR immunity. Streptococcus thermophilus phages circumvent host CRISPR defences via AcrIIIA2, which complexes with enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to block phage RNA binding.",

            "abstract": "Tandem light-emitting diodes (LEDs), achieved by vertically stacking multiple units in series to combine the luminance of individual light-emitting elements, are effective for improving efficiency and lifespan compared to single-unit devices1–3. In particular, tandem perovskite LEDs benefit from the small Stokes shifts of perovskites4, which in principle can enable significant photon recycling between individual perovskite layers and enhance light extraction from trapped modes. However, a tandem structure that effectively merges the luminance of each perovskite units still remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient and stable tandem LEDs by combining two solution-processed perovskite light-emitting units. This tandem structure effectively combines the original luminance of each light-emitting units; we argue that the emissions are also significantly enhanced through photon recycling between the individual light-emitting units. Consequently, we achieve tandem perovskite LEDs with a low turn-on voltage of 3.2 V, a high peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5% (even 20% higher than the sum of peak EQEs of single-unit devices), an average peak EQE of 40.9%, and a half-lifetime of 64 h at an initial radiance of 70 W Sr−1 m−2. These findings represent a significant advancement in achieving high-performance and multicolor LEDs through the stacking of perovskite LEDs.",

Nonetheless, effectively regulating the behavior of solid-state polymers using CO2 remains a considerable challenge, highlighting the need for robust and reliable strategies to address this issue. This study presents elastomers that feature nanophase-separated morphologies composed of CO2-vitrifiable polyethyleneimine and CO2-permeable polydimethylsiloxane components. The elastomers (Young’s modulus (E) of approximately 1 MPa) reversibly transform into hard plastics (E &gt; 2 GPa) in the presence of CO2. In addition to bulk stiffening, their surface adhesion and friction rapidly shift, and the material’s fluorescence is significantly amplified. Here, we show that these multifunctional responses to CO2 position the materials as innovative platforms for responsive mechanical systems and CO2-activated optical devices, with potential applications in sensing, display, and data storage technologies. Carbon dioxide responsive polymers are promising for smart technologies, though it is challenging to effectively regulate these properties reliably.

In addition to HSC clones with balanced contribution to all lineages, we identified clones with all myeloid lineages but no or few B and T lymphocytes or all myeloid lineages and B cells but no T cells. No other lineage restriction patterns were reproducibly observed.

Studies of both processes have largely focused on coding genes and have not accounted for transposable elements which comprise 50% of the X-chromosome with numerous epigenetic functions. Here we develop a new bioinformatic pipeline tailored to repetitive elements with capability for allelic discrimination. We then apply the pipeline to our recent So-Smart-Seq analysis of single embryos to comprehensively interrogate whether X-linked transposable elements are subject to either X-chromosome inactivation or Xa-hyperactivation. We observe significant differences in repeat silencing in parentally driven “imprinted” versus zygotically driven “random” X-chromosome inactivation. Chromosomal positioning, genetic background and evolutionary age impact their silencing. In contrast, transposable elements do not undergo Xa-hyperactivation. Evolutionary and functional implications are discussed. X-chromosome dosage compensation involves inactivation and hyperactivation, but the role of transposable elements is unclear. Here, the authors show that X-linked repeats are differentially silenced during inactivation but do not undergo hyperactivation.",

            "abstract": "Human SAMD9 and SAMD9L are duplicated genes that encode innate immune proteins restricting poxviruses and lentiviruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mutations in these genes are implicated in genetic diseases and cancer. Here we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogues of SAMD9/9L in the antibacteriophage defence system, Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease site was conserved in bacterial analogues and was essential for cell death, suggesting a fundamental role in defence across different life kingdoms. Despite this shared immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimpanzee and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions compared with the human orthologue. These SAMD9/9L adaptations probably resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Evolutionary characterization of Avs9 and SAMD9/9L provides a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viruses over billions of years of evolution. A search for analogues of the human SAMD9/9L antiviral genes identifies convergent evolution of this gene family in the bacterial and animal kingdoms, with species-specific and recent genomic signatures indicative of adaptations resulting from evolutionary arms races with viruses.",

Here we investigate H3K36me2 reprogramming in mouse early development and its role in post-implantation DNA methylation re-establishment. In oocytes, H3K36me2 accumulates in gene bodies upon transcription silencing and partially persists to the eight-cell stage. De novo H3K36me2 occurs at enhancers after zygotic genome activation, before spreading genome-wide after implantation, except on the inactive X chromosome. Mutation of the H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1 compromises global DNA methylation after implantation preferentially in extra-embryonic lineages and that at methylation-prone promoters, including those of germline-specific genes. However, DNA methylation establishment partially bypasses H3K36me2 through upregulated DNMT3B, a ‘leaky’ H3K36me2/3 reader. This contrasts with DNMT3A, which strictly requires H3K36me2/3 for DNA methylation through its PWWP domain. Finally, DNA methylation valleys escape de novo DNA methylation via PRC1/H2AK119ub1-mediated H3K36me2 exclusion. Thus, H3K36me2 reprogramming regulates lineage- and locus-specific post-implantation DNA methylation establishment. Lu, Wang et al. profile H3K36me2 throughout oocyte-to-embryo transition, pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and report a role for H3K36me2 in post-implantation embryos to re-establish lineage-specific DNA methylation.",

We observe significant differences in repeat silencing in parentally driven “imprinted” versus zygotically driven “random” X-chromosome inactivation.

In vivo experiments show that a population of epithelial progenitors that possesses pouch-inducing potential and expresses androgen, not female hormones as in other live-bearers, can trigger pouch ontogeny. Two mechanisms ensure functionality of the pouch: recruitment of pseudo-placenta-related cells characterized by expressed orthologous genes also found in mammalian uteri and co-option of specific cells for sticky eggs attached to specialized skin patches of males that express novel seahorse-specific genes such as pastns and syn-lectins. These mechanisms combined drove pouch diversity and complexity in syngnathids. Seahorses have a unique sex role reversal with male pregnancy involving the brood pouch, an evolutionarily novel organ.

Here we used a suite of single-cell approaches, including integrated live-cell imaging of secretion and cell fate, flow cytometry and high-content imaging, to investigate IL-1β secretion dynamics in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes. We found marked heterogeneity: a large fraction of cells remained viable and contributed negligibly to IL-1β secretion, challenging established models. Instead, a small subset (5–10%) undergoing canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis produced the majority of secreted IL-1β, with a smaller contribution from apoptotic cells transitioning to secondary necrosis. Single-cell profiling of CD14+ monocytes from patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome confirmed lytic cell death as the driver of pathological IL-1β release. These findings redefine IL-1β as a damage-associated molecular pattern, secreted predominantly by dying monocytes. Lamkanfi, Shirasaki, Izawa and colleagues show that IL-1β release in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or carrying NLRP3 activatory mutations is mostly restricted to cells undergoing lytic cell death.",

            "abstract": "In mammals, DNA methylation is re-established after implantation following post-fertilization global erasure. Yet, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here we investigate H3K36me2 reprogramming in mouse early development and its role in post-implantation DNA methylation re-establishment. In oocytes, H3K36me2 accumulates in gene bodies upon transcription silencing and partially persists to the eight-cell stage. De novo H3K36me2 occurs at enhancers after zygotic genome activation, before spreading genome-wide after implantation, except on the inactive X chromosome. Mutation of the H3K36me2 methyltransferase NSD1 compromises global DNA methylation after implantation preferentially in extra-embryonic lineages and that at methylation-prone promoters, including those of germline-specific genes. However, DNA methylation establishment partially bypasses H3K36me2 through upregulated DNMT3B, a ‘leaky’ H3K36me2/3 reader. This contrasts with DNMT3A, which strictly requires H3K36me2/3 for DNA methylation through its PWWP domain. Finally, DNA methylation valleys escape de novo DNA methylation via PRC1/H2AK119ub1-mediated H3K36me2 exclusion. Thus, H3K36me2 reprogramming regulates lineage- and locus-specific post-implantation DNA methylation establishment. Lu, Wang et al. profile H3K36me2 throughout oocyte-to-embryo transition, pre-implantation and early post-implantation development and report a role for H3K36me2 in post-implantation embryos to re-establish lineage-specific DNA methylation.",

Here, we aim to identify a critical oncogenic pathway involved in an antigen-expressing c-MYC-lucOSOE/Tp53KO hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model that simulates immune response against tumour-associated antigens. Using data-independent acquisition proteomics, we reveal the role of wild-type KRAS in immune escaped mouse HCC tumours, with EGF concurrently activating EGFR/MEK/ERK signalling. Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis reveals that KRAS signalling intrinsically inhibits interferon-mediated MHC-I expression and extrinsically impairs CD8+ T cell activity due to the suppression of CXCL9 through the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. We observe KRAS activation in HCC patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments, where it correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Notably, combination therapy with SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902, Trametinib, and anti-PD-1 antibody effectively increased intratumoural CD8+ T cell infiltration and improved survival. Our study thus reveals that targeting wild-type KRAS signalling in combination with ICIs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for advanced HCC patients.

Mutations in these genes are implicated in genetic diseases and cancer. Here we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogues of SAMD9/9L in the antibacteriophage defence system, Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease site was conserved in bacterial analogues and was essential for cell death, suggesting a fundamental role in defence across different life kingdoms. Despite this shared immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimpanzee and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions compared with the human orthologue. These SAMD9/9L adaptations probably resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Evolutionary characterization of Avs9 and SAMD9/9L provides a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viruses over billions of years of evolution. A search for analogues of the human SAMD9/9L antiviral genes identifies convergent evolution of this gene family in the bacterial and animal kingdoms, with species-specific and recent genomic signatures indicative of adaptations resulting from evolutionary arms races with viruses.",

Here we used a suite of single-cell approaches, including integrated live-cell imaging of secretion and cell fate, flow cytometry and high-content imaging, to investigate IL-1β secretion dynamics in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated primary human peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes. We found marked heterogeneity: a large fraction of cells remained viable and contributed negligibly to IL-1β secretion, challenging established models. Instead, a small subset (5–10%) undergoing canonical NLRP3 inflammasome activation and GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis produced the majority of secreted IL-1β, with a smaller contribution from apoptotic cells transitioning to secondary necrosis. Single-cell profiling of CD14+ monocytes from patients with cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome confirmed lytic cell death as the driver of pathological IL-1β release. These findings redefine IL-1β as a damage-associated molecular pattern, secreted predominantly by dying monocytes. Lamkanfi, Shirasaki, Izawa and colleagues show that IL-1β release in human monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or carrying NLRP3 activatory mutations is mostly restricted to cells undergoing lytic cell death.",

In response, phages use anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade CRISPR immunity. The few type III Acrs identified so far show conditional effectiveness in countering type III immunity or rely on unknown or poorly understood inhibitory mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of AcrIIIA2, a type III-A Acr encoded by Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Biochemical and structural analyses reveal that phage AcrIIIA2 co-opts host enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to form a ternary complex with the S. thermophilus type III-A (Csm) CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complex, obstructing its immune responses. The enolase-chaperoned AcrIIIA2 blocks the initial step of phage RNA binding, thereby preventing downstream type III anti-phage immune responses. Enolase participates in the anti-immune response by serving as an essential structural scaffold, stabilizing Acr–CRISPR interactions. These findings uncover a new anti-defence strategy that exploits a well-conserved host factor to block CRISPR immunity. Streptococcus thermophilus phages circumvent host CRISPR defences via AcrIIIA2, which complexes with enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to block phage RNA binding.",

Here, we aim to identify a critical oncogenic pathway involved in an antigen-expressing c-MYC-lucOSOE/Tp53KO hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse model that simulates immune response against tumour-associated antigens. Using data-independent acquisition proteomics, we reveal the role of wild-type KRAS in immune escaped mouse HCC tumours, with EGF concurrently activating EGFR/MEK/ERK signalling. Single cell RNA sequencing data analysis reveals that KRAS signalling intrinsically inhibits interferon-mediated MHC-I expression and extrinsically impairs CD8+ T cell activity due to the suppression of CXCL9 through the EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. We observe KRAS activation in HCC patients who received immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments, where it correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Notably, combination therapy with SOS1 inhibitor MRTX0902, Trametinib, and anti-PD-1 antibody effectively increased intratumoural CD8+ T cell infiltration and improved survival. Our study thus reveals that targeting wild-type KRAS signalling in combination with ICIs may serve as an effective treatment strategy for advanced HCC patients. Increasing evidence suggests that activation of oncogenic pathways contributes to an unfavorable tumor microenvironment.

We identify thousands of parts for reproducible editing in human and mouse cell lines, including hundreds with greater activity than commonly used sequences. Saturation mutagenesis screens identify tolerated sequence variants that further enhance sequence diversity. In an application to molecular recording, we design a ‘ten key’ array that, in mammalian cells, achieves balanced activity of pegRNAs as predicted by the activity of the component parts. The data reported here will aid the design of synthetic loci encoding arrays of gRNAs exhibiting predictable, differentiated levels of activity for applications in multiplexed perturbation, biological recorders and complex genetic circuits.

We introduce improv, a software platform for flexible integration of modeling, data collection, analysis pipelines, and live experimental control. We demonstrate both in silico and in vivo how improv enables efficient experimental designs for discovery and validation across various model organisms and data types. We used improv to orchestrate real-time behavioral analyses, rapid functional typing of neural responses via calcium imaging, optimal visual stimulus selection, and model-driven optogenetic photostimulation of visually responsive neurons in the zebrafish brain.

Here we design libraries of extant, ancestral, mutagenized or miniaturized variants of polymerase III promoters and guide RNA (gRNA) scaffolds and quantify their abilities to mediate precise edits to the mammalian genome through multiplex prime editing. We identify thousands of parts for reproducible editing in human and mouse cell lines, including hundreds with greater activity than commonly used sequences. Saturation mutagenesis screens identify tolerated sequence variants that further enhance sequence diversity. In an application to molecular recording, we design a ‘ten key’ array that, in mammalian cells, achieves balanced activity of pegRNAs as predicted by the activity of the component parts. The data reported here will aid the design of synthetic loci encoding arrays of gRNAs exhibiting predictable, differentiated levels of activity for applications in multiplexed perturbation, biological recorders and complex genetic circuits. Prime editing in mammalian cells benefits from a comprehensive list of genetic parts.",

Their male pregnancy is facilitated by an evolutionary novel organ—the brood pouch that functions analogously to the mammalian uterus and placenta despite originating from entirely different tissues. Here we use comparative single-cell multiomics and genomics analyses to investigate the transition from egg laying to pregnancy during syngnathid evolution and compare the convergently evolved life history of placental parental care with that in mammals. In vivo experiments show that a population of epithelial progenitors that possesses pouch-inducing potential and expresses androgen, not female hormones as in other live-bearers, can trigger pouch ontogeny. Two mechanisms ensure functionality of the pouch: recruitment of pseudo-placenta-related cells characterized by expressed orthologous genes also found in mammalian uteri and co-option of specific cells for sticky eggs attached to specialized skin patches of males that express novel seahorse-specific genes such as pastns and syn-lectins. These mechanisms combined drove pouch diversity and complexity in syngnathids. Seahorses have a unique sex role reversal with male pregnancy involving the brood pouch, an evolutionarily novel organ. This study uses single-cell genomics and in vivo experiments to reveal the cellular basis and molecular mechanism of pouch development and diversity in seahorses.",

Mutations in these genes are implicated in genetic diseases and cancer. Here we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogues of SAMD9/9L in the antibacteriophage defence system, Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease site was conserved in bacterial analogues and was essential for cell death, suggesting a fundamental role in defence across different life kingdoms. Despite this shared immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimpanzee and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions compared with the human orthologue. These SAMD9/9L adaptations probably resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Evolutionary characterization of Avs9 and SAMD9/9L provides a deeper understanding of how the immune system adapts to fight viruses over billions of years of evolution. A search for analogues of the human SAMD9/9L antiviral genes identifies convergent evolution of this gene family in the bacterial and animal kingdoms, with species-specific and recent genomic signatures indicative of adaptations resulting from evolutionary arms races with viruses.",

In addition to HSC clones with balanced contribution to all lineages, we identified clones with all myeloid lineages but no or few B and T lymphocytes or all myeloid lineages and B cells but no T cells. No other lineage restriction patterns were reproducibly observed. Retrospective phylogenetic inferences uncovered a ‘hierarchical’ pattern of descendant subclones more lineage biased than their ancestral clone and a more common ‘stable’ pattern with descendant subclones showing highly concordant lineage contributions with their ancestral clone, despite decades of separation.

            "abstract": "Dynamic steady-state lineage contribution of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) clones needs to be assessed over time. However, clonal contribution of HSCs has only been investigated at single time points and without assessing the critical erythroid and platelet lineages. Here we screened for somatic mutations in healthy aged individuals, identifying expanded HSC clones accessible for lineage tracing of all major blood cell lineages. In addition to HSC clones with balanced contribution to all lineages, we identified clones with all myeloid lineages but no or few B and T lymphocytes or all myeloid lineages and B cells but no T cells. No other lineage restriction patterns were reproducibly observed. Retrospective phylogenetic inferences uncovered a ‘hierarchical’ pattern of descendant subclones more lineage biased than their ancestral clone and a more common ‘stable’ pattern with descendant subclones showing highly concordant lineage contributions with their ancestral clone, despite decades of separation. Prospective lineage tracing confirmed remarkable stability over years of HSC clones with distinct lineage replenishment patterns. This study uses somatic mutations as a natural barcoding system to retrospectively and prospectively trace the fate of hematopoietic stem cells across all major blood cell lineages in healthy aged individuals. It reveals the existence of intrinsically fate-biased hematopoietic stem cells in native human hematopoiesis, validated by transplantation assays.",

In response, phages use anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade CRISPR immunity. The few type III Acrs identified so far show conditional effectiveness in countering type III immunity or rely on unknown or poorly understood inhibitory mechanisms. Here we report the discovery of AcrIIIA2, a type III-A Acr encoded by Streptococcus thermophilus phages. Biochemical and structural analyses reveal that phage AcrIIIA2 co-opts host enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to form a ternary complex with the S. thermophilus type III-A (Csm) CRISPR ribonucleoprotein complex, obstructing its immune responses. The enolase-chaperoned AcrIIIA2 blocks the initial step of phage RNA binding, thereby preventing downstream type III anti-phage immune responses. Enolase participates in the anti-immune response by serving as an essential structural scaffold, stabilizing Acr–CRISPR interactions. These findings uncover a new anti-defence strategy that exploits a well-conserved host factor to block CRISPR immunity. Streptococcus thermophilus phages circumvent host CRISPR defences via AcrIIIA2, which complexes with enolase, a highly abundant glycolysis enzyme, to block phage RNA binding.",

            "abstract": "Cell segmentation is the foundation of a wide range of microscopy-based biological studies. Deep learning has revolutionized two-dimensional (2D) cell segmentation, enabling generalized solutions across cell types and imaging modalities. This has been driven by the ease of scaling up image acquisition, annotation and computation. However, three-dimensional (3D) cell segmentation, requiring dense annotation of 2D slices, still poses substantial challenges. Manual labeling of 3D cells to train broadly applicable segmentation models is prohibitive. Even in high-contrast images annotation is ambiguous and time-consuming. Here we develop a theory and toolbox, u-Segment3D, for 2D-to-3D segmentation, compatible with any 2D method generating pixel-based instance cell masks. u-Segment3D translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data, as demonstrated on 11 real-life datasets, comprising &gt;70,000 cells, spanning single cells, cell aggregates and tissue. Moreover, u-Segment3D is competitive with native 3D segmentation, even exceeding when cells are crowded and have complex morphologies. u-Segment3D is a universal framework that translates and enhances 2D instance segmentations to a 3D consensus instance segmentation without training data. It performs well across diverse datasets, including cells with complex morphologies.",

However, the proteostasis system involved in ER-mediated protein quality control has not been fully characterized. Here we show that Ca2+ triggers the condensation of PDIA6, an ER-resident disulfide isomerase and molecular chaperone, into quality control granules. In contrast to the condensation mechanism observed for proteins containing low-complexity domains, our results indicate that transient but specific electrostatic interactions occur between the first and the third folded thioredoxin-like domains of PDIA6. We further show that the PDIA6 condensates recruit proinsulin, thereby accelerating the oxidative proinsulin folding and suppressing the proinsulin aggregation inside quality control granules, essential for secretion of insulin. Lee et al. show that Ca²⁺ triggers condensates enriched with PDIA6, an ER-resident disulfide isomerase and chaperone, along with other protein disulfide isomerase family proteins and some chaperones that in turn enhance folding of proinsulin.",
