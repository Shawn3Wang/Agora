            "abstract": "Translating mass spectra into chemical structures is a central challenge in exposomics, making it difficult to quickly track the millions of chemicals found in humans and the environment. Unlike metabolomics, key problems in developing models for chemicals with a larger molecular space include data scarcity, model complexity and proper query strategy. Here we present a molecular structure generator (MSGo) that can generate structures directly from mass spectra and discover unknown polyfluorinated chemicals in the exposome. Trained with only virtual spectra using a transformer neural network, MSGo correctly identified 48% of structures in a validation set and was better at discovering new polyfluorinated chemicals in wastewater samples reported in the literature than experts. Applying probability-oriented masking to the virtual spectra is key to MSGo’s performance. Rapid discovery of chemicals with limited experimental mass spectral data using automated tools such as MSGo is key to tackling the current unknown polyfluorinated chemical crisis. Yu and colleagues present MSGo, an artificial intelligence exposomics tool trained on virtual mass spectra with masking that identifies pollutants by generating chemical structures that match measured spectral data.",

We developed a random-forest machine learning (ML) model, CarbaDetector, to predict carbapenemase production from inhibition zone diameters of eight antibiotics, using 385 isolates for training with whole genome sequencing as reference. Validation on two external datasets (A = 282, B = 518 isolates) shows high performance: sensitivity/specificity are 96.6%/84.4% (training), 96.3%/86.1% (A), and 91.2%/87.0% (B, five antibiotics). In contrast, the algorithms of EUCAST and the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM) exhibit lower specificity (8.2% and 40.1%, respectively on the training dataset). In this work, we show that CarbaDetector, available as a web-app, reduces unnecessary confirmatory testing and accelerates the time to result. This approach offers high sensitivity and improved specificity compared to standard algorithms and has the potential to improve CPE detection, especially in resource-limited settings. Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics, but resistance is rising due to hydrolyzing enzymes called carbapenemases.

To accommodate the cryo-EM map information, CryoAtom replaces the global attention mechanism in AlphaFold2 with local attention, which is further enhanced by a novel three-dimensional rotary position embedding. CryoAtom produces more complete models, reduces the resolution requirement and accelerates the modeling. The application of CryoAtom to three large maps demonstrates its ability to detect previously uncharacterized proteins with unknown functions, improve the modeling of conformational changes and compartmentalize the map to isolate nonprotein components. A particular case includes a 104-protein complex that was modeled within a few hours and a minor conformational change of a single protein domain was detected at the periphery when models from two different maps were compared. CryoAtom stands as an accurate method currently available for model building of proteins in cryo-EM structure determination.

Although our group and others have demonstrated microbial presence in various tumors, recent controversies regarding cancer-type-specific intratumoral microbiota emphasize the importance of rigorous, orthogonal validation. This prospective, multi-institutional study included a total of 243 samples from 221 patients, comprising 168 glioma and brain metastases samples and 75 non-cancerous or tumor-adjacent tissues. Using stringent fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and high-resolution spatial imaging, we detected intracellular bacterial 16S rRNA and lipopolysaccharides in both glioma and brain metastases samples, localized to tumor, immune and stromal cells. Custom 16S and metagenomic sequencing workflows identified taxa associated with intratumoral bacterial signals in the tumor microenvironment; however, standard culture methods did not yield readily cultivable microbiota. Spatial analyses revealed significant correlations between bacterial 16S signals and antimicrobial and immunometabolic signatures at regional, neighborhood and cellular levels. Furthermore, intratumoral 16S bacterial signals showed sequence overlap with matched oral and gut microbiota, suggesting a possible connection with distant communities. Together, these findings introduce microbial elements as a component of the brain tumor microenvironment and lay the foundation for future mechanistic and translational studies. A combination of high-resolution spatial imaging, spatial proteomics and transcriptional data reveals sparse and heterogeneous bacterial signals in gliomas and brain metastases.",

We developed a random-forest machine learning (ML) model, CarbaDetector, to predict carbapenemase production from inhibition zone diameters of eight antibiotics, using 385 isolates for training with whole genome sequencing as reference. Validation on two external datasets (A = 282, B = 518 isolates) shows high performance: sensitivity/specificity are 96.6%/84.4% (training), 96.3%/86.1% (A), and 91.2%/87.0% (B, five antibiotics). In contrast, the algorithms of EUCAST and the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM) exhibit lower specificity (8.2% and 40.1%, respectively on the training dataset). In this work, we show that CarbaDetector, available as a web-app, reduces unnecessary confirmatory testing and accelerates the time to result. This approach offers high sensitivity and improved specificity compared to standard algorithms and has the potential to improve CPE detection, especially in resource-limited settings. Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics, but resistance is rising due to hydrolyzing enzymes called carbapenemases.

Recent research highlights the presence of intratumor bacteria across many tumor types, yet the microbiome of brain tumors remains largely underexplored. Here we show that the microbiome of 322 brain tumors differs markedly by tumor type and location. Using multiple approaches to visualize, culture and sequence bacterial communities, we found that brain metastases harbor higher bacterial richness and diversity than GBM, with distinct microbial compositions. Moreover, metastases in posterior brain regions exhibited greater diversity than those in anterior regions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways associated with tumor spread and metastasis in brain metastases while GBM was enriched with pathways supporting alternative phosphorus use. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial landscape of brain tumors, highlighting tumor-type-specific and location-specific variation and suggesting potential roles for bacteria in brain tumor biology. Using multiple visualization and profiling methods, Gigi et al. characterize the microbiome diversity of 322 brain tumors including brain metastases and glioblastomas.",

In some instances, bacteria appear to retain an imprint of past events that can influence future behaviour, resembling a form of memory. This Perspective explores this concept of bacterial memory at the genetic, epigenetic, biochemical and ecological levels. We discuss how memory can prime bacteria to respond appropriately to recurring stimuli, providing fitness benefits in fluctuating environments. At the cellular level, there is evidence for memory storage mechanisms involving mutations, DNA methylation, or the inheritance of metabolites or proteins that provide a means of accessing past experiences. Complex bacterial communities can exhibit ecological memories of past environments, stored as microbiota population changes that persist or lag after acute environmental change. We review the emerging evidence supporting these concepts of microbial memory, outline some of the key molecular mechanisms, and identify research gaps and potential future applications.

We identified 350 loci associated with hypothyroidism, including 179 not previously reported, 29 of which were linked through thyroid-stimulating hormone. We found that many hypothyroidism risk loci regulate blood cell counts and the circulating inflammasome, and through multiple gene-mapping strategies, we prioritized 259 putative causal genes enriched in immune-related functions. We developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on more than 115,000 hypothyroidism cases to address diagnostic challenges in individuals with or at risk of thyroid hormone deficiency. We show that the highest predictive accuracy for hypothyroidism was achieved when combining the PRS with thyroid hormones and thyroid-peroxidase autoantibodies, and that the PRS was able to stratify risk of progression among individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism. These findings demonstrate the potential for a hypothyroidism PRS to support the prediction of disease progression and onset in thyroid hormone deficiency. Large-scale genome-wide analyses identify hundreds of genetic loci associated with hypothyroidism and thyroid hormone levels, demonstrating the potential of using polygenic risk scores to predict disease onset and progression.",

We developed a random-forest machine learning (ML) model, CarbaDetector, to predict carbapenemase production from inhibition zone diameters of eight antibiotics, using 385 isolates for training with whole genome sequencing as reference. Validation on two external datasets (A = 282, B = 518 isolates) shows high performance: sensitivity/specificity are 96.6%/84.4% (training), 96.3%/86.1% (A), and 91.2%/87.0% (B, five antibiotics). In contrast, the algorithms of EUCAST and the Antibiogram Committee of the French Society of Microbiology (CA-SFM) exhibit lower specificity (8.2% and 40.1%, respectively on the training dataset). In this work, we show that CarbaDetector, available as a web-app, reduces unnecessary confirmatory testing and accelerates the time to result. This approach offers high sensitivity and improved specificity compared to standard algorithms and has the potential to improve CPE detection, especially in resource-limited settings. Carbapenems are last-resort antibiotics, but resistance is rising due to hydrolyzing enzymes called carbapenemases.

People with CD do not like sweets. Here we show that SLC25A13 loss causes the accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), which activates the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) to transcribe FGF21, which acts in the brain to restrain intake of sweets and alcohol and to transcribe key genes driving lipogenesis. Mouse and human data suggest that G3P–ChREBP is a mechanistic component of the Randle Cycle that contributes to metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and forms part of a system that communicates metabolic states from the liver to the brain in a manner that alters food and alcohol choices. The data provide a framework for understanding FGF21 induction in varied conditions, suggest ways to develop FGF21-inducing drugs and suggest potential drug candidates for lean metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and support of urea cycle function in CD. In a mouse model of the rare disease citrin deficiency, the authors discovered that the accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate leads to ChREBP activation and FGF21 induction.

At its core are degradation signals, or degrons, that initiate substrate engagement and ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here we highlight how a variety of degradation signals promote substrate–E3 ligase interactions to orchestrate protein turnover with precision. While short linear motifs are frequently identified as degrons, an increasing number of degrons have recently been mapped to high-order protein structures, underscoring the architectural diversity and cryptic nature of degradation signals. Furthermore, nonproteinaceous signals beyond degrons often facilitate the precise control of protein ubiquitination. These additional signals can reside within substrates and E3 ligases or at their interfaces. Finally, we discuss how dysregulation of degrons and degradation signals is linked to human diseases. A deeper mechanistic understanding of degradation signals will guide new therapeutic strategies, whether by restoring defective protein ubiquitination or by harnessing targeted protein degradation.

            "abstract": "While treatment remains essential, disease prevention often proves more effective in improving outcomes, enhancing well-being and reducing healthcare costs. Despite this understanding, preventative medical practices are still underutilized. Continuous monitoring technologies can help to address this gap by enabling early symptom detection, tracking disease recurrence and assessing treatment responses, yet few of the technologies have been integrated into clinical practice. In this Review, we discuss notable advances in continuous monitoring and the barriers to their translation. We focus on technologies that enable either continuous measurement for at least one week or periodic measurements for at least one month, including remotely interfacing technologies, wearables and other directly interfacing systems, and internally interfacing implanted devices. Continuous monitoring improves disease-risk assessment, tracks disease progression and enhances overall health management. However, broader and more reliable datasets from diverse clinical trials, alongside supportive policies and financial incentives, will be essential to overcoming translational barriers and to integrating these technologies into healthcare. This Review discusses how continuous monitoring technologies can enable early symptom detection, disease recurrence tracking and treatment response assessment, and how these technologies are being integrated into clinical practice.",

Recent research highlights the presence of intratumor bacteria across many tumor types, yet the microbiome of brain tumors remains largely underexplored. Here we show that the microbiome of 322 brain tumors differs markedly by tumor type and location. Using multiple approaches to visualize, culture and sequence bacterial communities, we found that brain metastases harbor higher bacterial richness and diversity than GBM, with distinct microbial compositions. Moreover, metastases in posterior brain regions exhibited greater diversity than those in anterior regions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways associated with tumor spread and metastasis in brain metastases while GBM was enriched with pathways supporting alternative phosphorus use. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial landscape of brain tumors, highlighting tumor-type-specific and location-specific variation and suggesting potential roles for bacteria in brain tumor biology.

Trained with only virtual spectra using a transformer neural network, MSGo correctly identified 48% of structures in a validation set and was better at discovering new polyfluorinated chemicals in wastewater samples reported in the literature than experts. Applying probability-oriented masking to the virtual spectra is key to MSGo’s performance. Rapid discovery of chemicals with limited experimental mass spectral data using automated tools such as MSGo is key to tackling the current unknown polyfluorinated chemical crisis.

            "abstract": "Ordered nanostructured magnetic networks offer a versatile platform for studying magnetic frustration, reconfigurable magnonics, and neuromorphic computing. Their fabrication, however, often relies on complicated and expensive nanolithography. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical strategy for growing large-area magnetic networks composed of self-organized triangular motifs separated by periodic parallel ridges. The ridges arise deterministically from voltage-controlled electrodeposition, while the regions between them undergo self-organization: cobalt nucleates, bifurcates, and assembles into either solid or hollow triangular units depending on the growth conditions. The global network morphology is dictated by the waveform of the applied voltage. These triangular structures host diverse magnetic states, including vortex-like and macro-spin-like configurations, and exhibit nonlinear responses to external magnetic fields. Our approach combines macroscopically controlled, deterministic growth and microscopic self-organization, providing a scalable pathway for fabricating complex nanostructures. The resulting magnetic networks show potential as physical reservoirs for neuromorphic computing. Self-organized growth often suffers from a lack of long-range order in preparing large-area nanostructures.

However, synthesizing high-quality graphene-based composites with high conductivity and ionic mobility remains challenging. Here, we report an allotrope to the nanocarbon family, Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene, synthesized by inserting π-π-conjugated p-phenyls between graphene layers and connecting them via C–C σ bonds. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene is thermally and dynamically stable, as verified by density functional theory and molecular dynamics, and can be produced at kilogram scale. The p-phenyl bridges swell the layer spacing from ~0.34 to ~0.56 nm, reducing van der Waals forces and enhancing electron delocalization. Electrons in these separated graphene layers benefit from low mass and efficient 3D screening of charge scattering, resulting in high Hall mobility (10,000–13,000 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) in freestanding films. The expanded spacing also enables decoupling of layer electrons and rapid ion storage and transport—even for large ions. For example, potassium-ion batteries using Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene exhibit high reversible capacity, long-term stability, and high charge-discharge rates. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene holds promise for large-scale, portable, high-performance electronics with energy storage capabilities.

At its core are degradation signals, or degrons, that initiate substrate engagement and ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here we highlight how a variety of degradation signals promote substrate–E3 ligase interactions to orchestrate protein turnover with precision. While short linear motifs are frequently identified as degrons, an increasing number of degrons have recently been mapped to high-order protein structures, underscoring the architectural diversity and cryptic nature of degradation signals. Furthermore, nonproteinaceous signals beyond degrons often facilitate the precise control of protein ubiquitination. These additional signals can reside within substrates and E3 ligases or at their interfaces. Finally, we discuss how dysregulation of degrons and degradation signals is linked to human diseases. A deeper mechanistic understanding of degradation signals will guide new therapeutic strategies, whether by restoring defective protein ubiquitination or by harnessing targeted protein degradation. Degrons are degradation signals in target proteins to direct recognition and degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system.

The dynamics of loop extrusion and its regulation remain poorly characterized in vivo. Here we tracked the motion of TAD anchors in living human cells to visualize and quantify cohesin-dependent loop extrusion across multiple endogenous genomic regions. We show that TADs are dynamic structures whose anchors are brought in proximity about once per hour and for 6–19 min (~16% of the time). Moreover, TADs are continuously extruded by multiple cohesin complexes. Remarkably, despite strong differences in Hi-C patterns across chromatin regions, their dynamics is consistent with the same density, residence time and speed of cohesin. Our results suggest that TAD dynamics is primarily governed by the location and affinity of CTCF sites, enabling genome-wide predictive models of cohesin-dependent chromatin interactions. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy and polymer simulations in human HCT116 cells show similar cohesin density, residence times and extrusion speed across multiple genomic regions.",

            "abstract": "Ordered nanostructured magnetic networks offer a versatile platform for studying magnetic frustration, reconfigurable magnonics, and neuromorphic computing. Their fabrication, however, often relies on complicated and expensive nanolithography. Here, we demonstrate an electrochemical strategy for growing large-area magnetic networks composed of self-organized triangular motifs separated by periodic parallel ridges. The ridges arise deterministically from voltage-controlled electrodeposition, while the regions between them undergo self-organization: cobalt nucleates, bifurcates, and assembles into either solid or hollow triangular units depending on the growth conditions. The global network morphology is dictated by the waveform of the applied voltage. These triangular structures host diverse magnetic states, including vortex-like and macro-spin-like configurations, and exhibit nonlinear responses to external magnetic fields. Our approach combines macroscopically controlled, deterministic growth and microscopic self-organization, providing a scalable pathway for fabricating complex nanostructures. The resulting magnetic networks show potential as physical reservoirs for neuromorphic computing. Self-organized growth often suffers from a lack of long-range order in preparing large-area nanostructures.

However, synthesizing high-quality graphene-based composites with high conductivity and ionic mobility remains challenging. Here, we report an allotrope to the nanocarbon family, Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene, synthesized by inserting π-π-conjugated p-phenyls between graphene layers and connecting them via C–C σ bonds. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene is thermally and dynamically stable, as verified by density functional theory and molecular dynamics, and can be produced at kilogram scale. The p-phenyl bridges swell the layer spacing from ~0.34 to ~0.56 nm, reducing van der Waals forces and enhancing electron delocalization. Electrons in these separated graphene layers benefit from low mass and efficient 3D screening of charge scattering, resulting in high Hall mobility (10,000–13,000 cm² V⁻¹ s⁻¹) in freestanding films. The expanded spacing also enables decoupling of layer electrons and rapid ion storage and transport—even for large ions. For example, potassium-ion batteries using Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene exhibit high reversible capacity, long-term stability, and high charge-discharge rates. Graphene-P-phenyl-Graphene holds promise for large-scale, portable, high-performance electronics with energy storage capabilities.

At its core are degradation signals, or degrons, that initiate substrate engagement and ubiquitination by E3 ubiquitin ligases. Here we highlight how a variety of degradation signals promote substrate–E3 ligase interactions to orchestrate protein turnover with precision. While short linear motifs are frequently identified as degrons, an increasing number of degrons have recently been mapped to high-order protein structures, underscoring the architectural diversity and cryptic nature of degradation signals. Furthermore, nonproteinaceous signals beyond degrons often facilitate the precise control of protein ubiquitination. These additional signals can reside within substrates and E3 ligases or at their interfaces. Finally, we discuss how dysregulation of degrons and degradation signals is linked to human diseases. A deeper mechanistic understanding of degradation signals will guide new therapeutic strategies, whether by restoring defective protein ubiquitination or by harnessing targeted protein degradation. Degrons are degradation signals in target proteins to direct recognition and degradation by the ubiquitin–proteasome system.

Here we uncover the structural basis for the function of NifEN, the scaffold protein that mediates the final stages of cofactor biosynthesis before its incorporation into nitrogenase. High-resolution structural analyses reveal that the cofactor precursor initially binds at a surface docking site before being transferred into a specialized cavity for further maturation. This process involves dynamic structural rearrangements, including coordinated domain motions and partial unfolding, enabling the scaffold to alternate between open and closed states. Additionally, a rear channel extends to the precursor-binding cavity, likely facilitating the entry of the modifying components molybdenum and homocitrate. These findings illuminate the dynamic mechanisms underlying FeMo-cofactor assembly and underscore the functional divergence between NifEN, the biosynthetic scaffold, and NifDK, the catalytic component of nitrogenase.

Herein, we have developed a groundbreaking Janus nanofiber structure inspired by the structural characteristics of plant leaves, specifically the pore gradient and liquid transport channels within leaves. An innovative intermediate buffer layer composed of a three-dimensional helical nanofiber membrane was introduced to boost porosity and horizontal interconnectivity. A dopamine-controlled regulation mechanism synergistically optimized the pore structure and wettability of this layer. The resulting Janus membrane exhibits a remarkable unidirectional transport index (1250%), a high oil-water separation efficiency (98.92%), and an ultra-high flux (13860.77 L·m⁻²·h⁻¹). Its integration with textiles demonstrates superior moisture and thermal management, confirming its versatility for applications in oil-water separation, industrial wastewater treatment, and high-performance functional garments. Directional liquid transport driven by the asymmetric properties of Janus fiber membranes has been used in oil-water separation and moisture management but showing limited water transport efficiency. Here, the authors optimize the porous channels of directional liquid transport Janus fiber membranes by integrating longitudinal channels with a horizontal network.",

            "abstract": "Topological photonics and acoustics have attracted wide research interest for their ability to manipulate light and sound at surfaces. The supercell technique is the conventional standard approach used to calculate these boundary effects, but, as the supercell grows in size, this method requires increasingly large computational resources. Additionally, it falls short in differentiating the surface states at opposite boundaries and, due to finite-size effects, from bulk states. Here, to overcome these limitations, we provide two complementary efficient methods for obtaining the ideal topological surface states of semi-infinite systems of diverse surface configurations. The first is the cyclic reduction method, which is based on iteratively inverting the Hamiltonian for a single unit cell, and the other is the transfer matrix method, which relies on eigenanalysis of a transfer matrix for a pair of unit cells. Numerical benchmarks, including gyromagnetic photonic crystals, valley photonic crystals, spin-Hall acoustic crystals and quadrupole photonic crystals, jointly show that both methods can effectively sort out the boundary modes via the surface density of states, at reduced computational cost and increased speed. Our computational schemes enable direct comparisons with near-field scanning measurements, thereby expediting the exploration of topological artificial materials and the design of topological devices. This study reports two efficient methods—cyclic reduction and transfer matrix—to compute topological surface states in photonic and acoustic systems, cutting memory and time use by up to 100-fold and enabling the faster design of advanced topological devices.",

Despite this understanding, preventative medical practices are still underutilized. Continuous monitoring technologies can help to address this gap by enabling early symptom detection, tracking disease recurrence and assessing treatment responses, yet few of the technologies have been integrated into clinical practice. In this Review, we discuss notable advances in continuous monitoring and the barriers to their translation. We focus on technologies that enable either continuous measurement for at least one week or periodic measurements for at least one month, including remotely interfacing technologies, wearables and other directly interfacing systems, and internally interfacing implanted devices. Continuous monitoring improves disease-risk assessment, tracks disease progression and enhances overall health management. However, broader and more reliable datasets from diverse clinical trials, alongside supportive policies and financial incentives, will be essential to overcoming translational barriers and to integrating these technologies into healthcare. This Review discusses how continuous monitoring technologies can enable early symptom detection, disease recurrence tracking and treatment response assessment, and how these technologies are being integrated into clinical practice.",

Although our group and others have demonstrated microbial presence in various tumors, recent controversies regarding cancer-type-specific intratumoral microbiota emphasize the importance of rigorous, orthogonal validation. This prospective, multi-institutional study included a total of 243 samples from 221 patients, comprising 168 glioma and brain metastases samples and 75 non-cancerous or tumor-adjacent tissues. Using stringent fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and high-resolution spatial imaging, we detected intracellular bacterial 16S rRNA and lipopolysaccharides in both glioma and brain metastases samples, localized to tumor, immune and stromal cells. Custom 16S and metagenomic sequencing workflows identified taxa associated with intratumoral bacterial signals in the tumor microenvironment; however, standard culture methods did not yield readily cultivable microbiota. Spatial analyses revealed significant correlations between bacterial 16S signals and antimicrobial and immunometabolic signatures at regional, neighborhood and cellular levels. Furthermore, intratumoral 16S bacterial signals showed sequence overlap with matched oral and gut microbiota, suggesting a possible connection with distant communities. Together, these findings introduce microbial elements as a component of the brain tumor microenvironment and lay the foundation for future mechanistic and translational studies. A combination of high-resolution spatial imaging, spatial proteomics and transcriptional data reveals sparse and heterogeneous bacterial signals in gliomas and brain metastases.",

Recent research highlights the presence of intratumor bacteria across many tumor types, yet the microbiome of brain tumors remains largely underexplored. Here we show that the microbiome of 322 brain tumors differs markedly by tumor type and location. Using multiple approaches to visualize, culture and sequence bacterial communities, we found that brain metastases harbor higher bacterial richness and diversity than GBM, with distinct microbial compositions. Moreover, metastases in posterior brain regions exhibited greater diversity than those in anterior regions. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of bacterial metabolic pathways associated with tumor spread and metastasis in brain metastases while GBM was enriched with pathways supporting alternative phosphorus use. These findings provide valuable insights into the microbial landscape of brain tumors, highlighting tumor-type-specific and location-specific variation and suggesting potential roles for bacteria in brain tumor biology. Using multiple visualization and profiling methods, Gigi et al. characterize the microbiome diversity of 322 brain tumors including brain metastases and glioblastomas.",

People with CD do not like sweets. Here we show that SLC25A13 loss causes the accumulation of glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), which activates the carbohydrate response element-binding protein (ChREBP) to transcribe FGF21, which acts in the brain to restrain intake of sweets and alcohol and to transcribe key genes driving lipogenesis. Mouse and human data suggest that G3P–ChREBP is a mechanistic component of the Randle Cycle that contributes to metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and forms part of a system that communicates metabolic states from the liver to the brain in a manner that alters food and alcohol choices. The data provide a framework for understanding FGF21 induction in varied conditions, suggest ways to develop FGF21-inducing drugs and suggest potential drug candidates for lean metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and support of urea cycle function in CD.

Here we uncover the structural basis for the function of NifEN, the scaffold protein that mediates the final stages of cofactor biosynthesis before its incorporation into nitrogenase. High-resolution structural analyses reveal that the cofactor precursor initially binds at a surface docking site before being transferred into a specialized cavity for further maturation. This process involves dynamic structural rearrangements, including coordinated domain motions and partial unfolding, enabling the scaffold to alternate between open and closed states. Additionally, a rear channel extends to the precursor-binding cavity, likely facilitating the entry of the modifying components molybdenum and homocitrate. These findings illuminate the dynamic mechanisms underlying FeMo-cofactor assembly and underscore the functional divergence between NifEN, the biosynthetic scaffold, and NifDK, the catalytic component of nitrogenase.

This suggests our understanding of TGFβ’s function is incomplete. Here we show that this therapeutic failure is rooted in a fundamental paradox: while TGFβ promotes malignant traits in gastric cancer, many cancer cells remain sensitive to its potent tumor-suppressive effects. We uncover that this suppression works by impairing the cell’s energy metabolism through modulating dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD). Therefore, broadly blocking the TGFβ pathway can inadvertently release a natural brake on tumor growth. Based on this insight, we demonstrate that co-targeting this metabolic vulnerability with an inhibitor (devimistat) alongside an anti-TGFβ agent significantly enhances therapeutic efficacy in gastric cancer models. This combination approach presents a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of current therapies. The role of TGFβ in cancer is paradoxical and context-dependent. Here, the authors discover that a preserved, DLD-mediated metabolic suppression by TGFβ undermines anti-TGFβ therapy, promoting gastric cancer growth.",

Identifying potential human miRNA-drug associations (MDAs) that manifest as resistance or sensitivity relationships offers valuable insights for cancer treatment and drug development. With the growing availability of biological data, computational methods have emerged as powerful tools to complement experimental approaches.

Although our group and others have demonstrated microbial presence in various tumors, recent controversies regarding cancer-type-specific intratumoral microbiota emphasize the importance of rigorous, orthogonal validation. This prospective, multi-institutional study included a total of 243 samples from 221 patients, comprising 168 glioma and brain metastases samples and 75 non-cancerous or tumor-adjacent tissues. Using stringent fluorescence in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and high-resolution spatial imaging, we detected intracellular bacterial 16S rRNA and lipopolysaccharides in both glioma and brain metastases samples, localized to tumor, immune and stromal cells. Custom 16S and metagenomic sequencing workflows identified taxa associated with intratumoral bacterial signals in the tumor microenvironment; however, standard culture methods did not yield readily cultivable microbiota. Spatial analyses revealed significant correlations between bacterial 16S signals and antimicrobial and immunometabolic signatures at regional, neighborhood and cellular levels. Furthermore, intratumoral 16S bacterial signals showed sequence overlap with matched oral and gut microbiota, suggesting a possible connection with distant communities. Together, these findings introduce microbial elements as a component of the brain tumor microenvironment and lay the foundation for future mechanistic and translational studies. A combination of high-resolution spatial imaging, spatial proteomics and transcriptional data reveals sparse and heterogeneous bacterial signals in gliomas and brain metastases.",

We identified 350 loci associated with hypothyroidism, including 179 not previously reported, 29 of which were linked through thyroid-stimulating hormone. We found that many hypothyroidism risk loci regulate blood cell counts and the circulating inflammasome, and through multiple gene-mapping strategies, we prioritized 259 putative causal genes enriched in immune-related functions. We developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on more than 115,000 hypothyroidism cases to address diagnostic challenges in individuals with or at risk of thyroid hormone deficiency. We show that the highest predictive accuracy for hypothyroidism was achieved when combining the PRS with thyroid hormones and thyroid-peroxidase autoantibodies, and that the PRS was able to stratify risk of progression among individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism. These findings demonstrate the potential for a hypothyroidism PRS to support the prediction of disease progression and onset in thyroid hormone deficiency.

We identified 350 loci associated with hypothyroidism, including 179 not previously reported, 29 of which were linked through thyroid-stimulating hormone. We found that many hypothyroidism risk loci regulate blood cell counts and the circulating inflammasome, and through multiple gene-mapping strategies, we prioritized 259 putative causal genes enriched in immune-related functions. We developed a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on more than 115,000 hypothyroidism cases to address diagnostic challenges in individuals with or at risk of thyroid hormone deficiency. We show that the highest predictive accuracy for hypothyroidism was achieved when combining the PRS with thyroid hormones and thyroid-peroxidase autoantibodies, and that the PRS was able to stratify risk of progression among individuals with subclinical hypothyroidism. These findings demonstrate the potential for a hypothyroidism PRS to support the prediction of disease progression and onset in thyroid hormone deficiency.

The dynamics of loop extrusion and its regulation remain poorly characterized in vivo. Here we tracked the motion of TAD anchors in living human cells to visualize and quantify cohesin-dependent loop extrusion across multiple endogenous genomic regions. We show that TADs are dynamic structures whose anchors are brought in proximity about once per hour and for 6–19 min (~16% of the time). Moreover, TADs are continuously extruded by multiple cohesin complexes. Remarkably, despite strong differences in Hi-C patterns across chromatin regions, their dynamics is consistent with the same density, residence time and speed of cohesin. Our results suggest that TAD dynamics is primarily governed by the location and affinity of CTCF sites, enabling genome-wide predictive models of cohesin-dependent chromatin interactions. Live-cell fluorescence microscopy and polymer simulations in human HCT116 cells show similar cohesin density, residence times and extrusion speed across multiple genomic regions.",

We discuss how memory can prime bacteria to respond appropriately to recurring stimuli, providing fitness benefits in fluctuating environments. At the cellular level, there is evidence for memory storage mechanisms involving mutations, DNA methylation, or the inheritance of metabolites or proteins that provide a means of accessing past experiences. Complex bacterial communities can exhibit ecological memories of past environments, stored as microbiota population changes that persist or lag after acute environmental change. We review the emerging evidence supporting these concepts of microbial memory, outline some of the key molecular mechanisms, and identify research gaps and potential future applications.

Bennett, Igor Filipović, Gordana RašićClose-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters for several aquatic and terrestrial species. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vectorAedes aegyptias a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods.",

For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vector Aedes aegypti as a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods.",

In some instances, bacteria appear to retain an imprint of past events that can influence future behaviour, resembling a form of memory. This Perspective explores this concept of bacterial memory at the genetic, epigenetic, biochemical and ecological levels. We discuss how memory can prime bacteria to respond appropriately to recurring stimuli, providing fitness benefits in fluctuating environments. At the cellular level, there is evidence for memory storage mechanisms involving mutations, DNA methylation, or the inheritance of metabolites or proteins that provide a means of accessing past experiences. Complex bacterial communities can exhibit ecological memories of past environments, stored as microbiota population changes that persist or lag after acute environmental change. We review the emerging evidence supporting these concepts of microbial memory, outline some of the key molecular mechanisms, and identify research gaps and potential future applications. This Perspective discusses the concept, mechanisms and evidence for memory in bacteria at individual and community levels.",

In this study, we present a head-to-head comparison of topological data analysis and information-theoretic approaches to describing higher-order interactions in multivariate data; with the goal of assessing the similarities, and differences, between how the frameworks define “higher-order structures.” We begin with toy examples with known topologies (spheres, toroids, planes, and knots), before turning to more complex, naturalistic data: fMRI signals collected from the human brain. We find that intrinsic, higher-order synergistic information is associated with three-dimensional cavities in an embedded point cloud: shapes such as spheres and hollow toroids are synergy-dominated, regardless of how the data is rotated. In fMRI data, we find strong correlations between synergistic information and both the number and size of three-dimensional cavities. Furthermore, we find that dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA preferentially represent higher-order redundancies, and largely fail to preserve both higher-order information and topological structure, suggesting that common manifold-based approaches to studying high-dimensional data are systematically failing to identify important features of the data. These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.",

These results point towards the possibility of developing a rich theory of higher-order interactions that spans topological and information-theoretic approaches while simultaneously highlighting the profound limitations of more conventional methods.",
