            "abstract": "Marburg virus (MARV) is a filovirus that causes a severe and often lethal hemorrhagic fever1,2. Despite the increasing frequency of MARV outbreaks, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use in humans. Here, we designed mutations that improve the expression, thermostability, and immunogenicity of the prefusion MARV glycoprotein (GP) ectodomain trimer, which is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in development3–8. We discovered a fully human, pan-marburgvirus monoclonal antibody, MARV16, that broadly neutralizes all MARV isolates as well as Ravn virus and Dehong virus with 40 to 100-fold increased potency relative to previously described antibodies9. Moreover, MARV16 provides therapeutic protection in guinea pigs challenged with MARV. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of MARV16-bound MARV GP showing that MARV16 recognizes a prefusion-specific epitope spanning GP1 and GP2, blocking receptor binding and preventing conformational changes required for viral entry. We further reveal the architecture of the MARV GP glycan cap, which shields the receptor binding site (RBS), underscoring architectural similarities with distantly related filovirus GPs. MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies9–11 can bind MARV GP simultaneously. These antibody cocktails require multiple mutations to escape neutralization by both antibodies, paving the way for MARV therapeutics resilient to viral evolution. MARV GP stabilization along with the discovery of MARV16 advance prevention and treatment options for MARV.",

Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity1–3. Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of cells in intestinal fistulae of patients with Crohn’s disease reveals the existence of specialized fistula-associated cell states with distinct signalling profiles and extracellular matrix architecture.",

            "abstract": "Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies1. NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis2,3, but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases. CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide screening shows that SIGLEC12 mediates plasma membrane rupture in cells undergoing necroptosis, possibly through a human-specific mechanism, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target.",

While programmed cell death is known to drive inflammation, its role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains unclear. Using gene-targeted murine COVID-19 models, we here find that caspase-8 is critical for cytokine release and inflammation. Loss of caspase-8 reduces disease severity and viral load in mice, and this occurs independently of its apoptotic function. Instead, reduction in SARS-CoV-2 pathology is linked to decreased IL-1β levels and inflammation. Loss of pyroptosis and necroptosis mediators in gene-targeted animals provides no additional benefits in mitigating disease outcomes beyond that conferred by loss of caspase-8. Spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of caspase-8-deficient mice confirm that improved outcomes are due to reduced pro-inflammatory responses, rather than changes in cell death signalling. Elevated expression of caspase-8 and cFLIP in infected lungs, alongside caspase-8-mediated cleavage of N4BP1, a suppressor of NF-kB signalling, indicates a role of this signalling axis in pathological inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight non-apoptotic functions of caspase-8 as a driver of severe COVID-19 through modulation of inflammation, not through the induction of apoptosis. During SARS-CoV-2 infection caspase-8 fuels harmful inflammation independent of apoptosis. Genetic loss of caspase-8 reduces cytokine levels, lowers viral load and mitigates disease severity, revealing non-apoptotic caspase-8 as a key driver of severe COVID-19.",

            "abstract": "Group 2 innate lymphocytes (ILC2s) are prevalent in small intestine but their role during homeostasis is unclear. Here we show that thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)—a cytokine implicated in ILC2 activation—is expressed constitutively in subepithelial fibroblasts, including telocytes and crypt-associated trophocytes, which are specialized fibroblasts necessary to sustain epithelial identity. Feeding increases TSLP and induces ILC2 type 2 cytokines that are attenuated by deletion of TSLP in fibroblasts or TSLP receptor on ILC2s. Both mouse and human intestinal fibroblasts express receptors for glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2)—an intestinotrophic growth factor released by enteroendocrine cells following food intake. GLP-2 promotes intestinal TSLP in mouse and human intestinal fibroblasts, and TSLP-dependent ILC2 activation and tuft cell hyperplasia in mice, thus linking nutrient detection with ILC2-mediated amplification of the tuft cell chemosensory circuit that promotes epithelial surveillance of ingested cargo. Locksley and colleagues describe a nutrient-sensing circuit in the small intestine. Upon feeding, TSLP production from fibroblasts is increased in a GLP-2-dependent manner, resulting in increased ILC2 activation and tuft cell hyperplasia, thus linking food intake with ILC2 activation.",

Despite the increasing frequency of MARV outbreaks, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use in humans. Here, we designed mutations that improve the expression, thermostability, and immunogenicity of the prefusion MARV glycoprotein (GP) ectodomain trimer, which is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in development3–8. We discovered a fully human, pan-marburgvirus monoclonal antibody, MARV16, that broadly neutralizes all MARV isolates as well as Ravn virus and Dehong virus with 40 to 100-fold increased potency relative to previously described antibodies9. Moreover, MARV16 provides therapeutic protection in guinea pigs challenged with MARV. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of MARV16-bound MARV GP showing that MARV16 recognizes a prefusion-specific epitope spanning GP1 and GP2, blocking receptor binding and preventing conformational changes required for viral entry. We further reveal the architecture of the MARV GP glycan cap, which shields the receptor binding site (RBS), underscoring architectural similarities with distantly related filovirus GPs. MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies9–11 can bind MARV GP simultaneously. These antibody cocktails require multiple mutations to escape neutralization by both antibodies, paving the way for MARV therapeutics resilient to viral evolution. MARV GP stabilization along with the discovery of MARV16 advance prevention and treatment options for MARV.",

We introduce ToxPredictor, a toxicogenomics framework combining RNA-seq data from primary human hepatocytes with pharmacokinetic data to predict dose-resolved DILI risks and safety margins. At its core is DILImap, an RNA-seq library tailored for DILI research, comprising 300 compounds at multiple concentrations. ToxPredictor achieves 88% sensitivity at 100% specificity in blind validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It flagged recent phase III clinical failures, including Evobrutinib, TAK-875, and BMS-986142, overlooked by animal studies. Beyond prediction, ToxPredictor provides mechanistic insights into hepatotoxic pathways, enabling early de-risking and actionable safety decisions. Unlike single-endpoint readouts—even from 3D models—transcriptomics offers a multi-dimensional system-level view of hepatocyte responses, capable of detecting diverse DILI mechanisms not captured by conventional assays. Scalable, actionable, and integrated into a broader AI/ML drug discovery platform, this work establishes toxicogenomics as a promising tool for developing safer therapeutics and addressing one of the most pressing challenges in toxicology. Drug-induced liver injury is a major cause of patient harm, trial failures, and drug withdrawals.

Despite these advances, the compartmentalized approach to computer-aided molecular design and synthesis remains a critical bottleneck, limiting further optimization of the design–make–test–analyze cycle. Here, to this end, we introduce SynGFN, which models molecular design as a cascade of simulated chemical reactions, enabling the assembly of molecules from synthesizable building blocks. SynGFN features two key ingredients: (1) a hierarchically pretrained policy network that accelerates learning across diverse distributions of desirable molecules in chemical spaces, and (2) a multifidelity acquisition framework to alleviate the cost of reward evaluations. These technical developments collectively endow SynGFN with the capability to explore a chemical space up to an order of magnitude larger (measured in terms of #Circles) than that of other synthesis-aware generative models, while identifying the most diverse, synthesizable and high-performance molecules. We demonstrate SynGFN’s potential impacts by designing inhibitors for GluN1/GluN3A, a therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders. A persistent gap from theoretical molecules to experimentally viable compounds has hindered the practical adoption of generative algorithms.

            "abstract": "Rapidly proliferating cells require large amounts of nucleotides, making nucleotide metabolism a widely exploited therapeutic target against cancer, autoinflammatory disorders and viral infections. However, regulation of nucleotide metabolism remains incompletely understood. Here, we reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Using uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we show that coenzyme Q (CoQ) is dispensable for pyrimidine synthesis, in the presence of the demethoxy-CoQ intermediate as alternative electron acceptor. We further report that the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT5 directly binds PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis, which inhibits its activity and preserves the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool. In the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis exhausts the PRPP pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, which promotes resistance to purine and pyrimidine nucleobase analogues. Of note, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT is disrupted by PRPP, highlighting an intricate allosteric regulation. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism of nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a regulator of nucleobase analogue metabolism. A uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies demethoxy-CoQ as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of CoQ, and NUDT5 as a regulator of de novo pyrimidine synthesis via its interaction with PPAT.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to skeletal muscle wasting in cancer cachexia, yet the upstream molecular drivers remain elusive. Here we show that cancer impairs the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and of its transcriptional effector CREB1 in skeletal muscle, ultimately contributing to the downregulation of a core transcriptional network that supports mitochondrial integrity and function. The restoration of cAMP–PKA–CREB1 signalling through pharmacological inhibition of the cAMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) rescues the expression of mitochondrial-related genes, improves mitochondrial function and mitigates skeletal muscle wasting in male mice. Altogether, our data identify tumour-induced suppression of the cAMP–PKA–CREB1 axis as a central mechanism contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia. Furthermore, these findings highlight PDE4, particularly the PDE4D isoform, as a potential therapeutic target to preserve muscle mitochondrial function and counteract muscle wasting in cancer cachexia. Tumour-induced dysregulation of cAMP–PKA–CREB1 signalling in skeletal muscle is shown to be a driver of mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to cancer cachexia in mice.",

For some of the compounds, symbiotic bacteria have been established as the actual producers. Among the known sponge symbionts, ‘Candidatus Entotheonella’ members stand out because of their abundant and variable biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Here, to obtain broader insights into this producer taxon, we conduct a comparative analysis on eight sponges through metagenomic and single-bacterial sequencing and biochemical studies. The data suggest sets of biosynthetic genes that are largely unique in 14 ‘Entotheonella’ candidate species and a member of a sister lineage named ‘Candidatus Proxinella’. Four biosynthetic loci were linked in silico or experimentally to cytotoxins, antibiotics and the terpene cembrene A from corals. The results support widespread and diverse bacterial roles in the chemistry of sponges and aid the development of sustainable production methods for sponge-derived therapeutics.

Despite the increasing frequency of MARV outbreaks, no vaccines or therapeutics are licensed for use in humans. Here, we designed mutations that improve the expression, thermostability, and immunogenicity of the prefusion MARV glycoprotein (GP) ectodomain trimer, which is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines in development3–8. We discovered a fully human, pan-marburgvirus monoclonal antibody, MARV16, that broadly neutralizes all MARV isolates as well as Ravn virus and Dehong virus with 40 to 100-fold increased potency relative to previously described antibodies9. Moreover, MARV16 provides therapeutic protection in guinea pigs challenged with MARV. We determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of MARV16-bound MARV GP showing that MARV16 recognizes a prefusion-specific epitope spanning GP1 and GP2, blocking receptor binding and preventing conformational changes required for viral entry. We further reveal the architecture of the MARV GP glycan cap, which shields the receptor binding site (RBS), underscoring architectural similarities with distantly related filovirus GPs. MARV16 and previously identified RBS-directed antibodies9–11 can bind MARV GP simultaneously. These antibody cocktails require multiple mutations to escape neutralization by both antibodies, paving the way for MARV therapeutics resilient to viral evolution. MARV GP stabilization along with the discovery of MARV16 advance prevention and treatment options for MARV.",

            "abstract": "Since late 2021, a panzootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 has devastated wild birds, agriculture and mammals. Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015&nbsp;(refs. 1,2), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention. The panzootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 since 2021 was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild migratory birds, primarily Anseriformes.",

            "abstract": "Marine picocyanobacteria are abundant photosynthetic organisms of global importance. They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages—viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit1–5. One such gene is nblA, which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6–8. Under nutrient deprivation cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9–11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light-harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation6,8,13. However, the benefit of the virus-encoded NblA for cyanophages and the broader impact on the host are unclear. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that viral NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and comprise 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of NblA to the cyanophage, while it exerts a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA has an adverse global impact on light harvesting by oceanic picocyanobacteria. Viral NblA accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency.",

While programmed cell death is known to drive inflammation, its role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains unclear. Using gene-targeted murine COVID-19 models, we here find that caspase-8 is critical for cytokine release and inflammation. Loss of caspase-8 reduces disease severity and viral load in mice, and this occurs independently of its apoptotic function. Instead, reduction in SARS-CoV-2 pathology is linked to decreased IL-1β levels and inflammation. Loss of pyroptosis and necroptosis mediators in gene-targeted animals provides no additional benefits in mitigating disease outcomes beyond that conferred by loss of caspase-8. Spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of caspase-8-deficient mice confirm that improved outcomes are due to reduced pro-inflammatory responses, rather than changes in cell death signalling. Elevated expression of caspase-8 and cFLIP in infected lungs, alongside caspase-8-mediated cleavage of N4BP1, a suppressor of NF-kB signalling, indicates a role of this signalling axis in pathological inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight non-apoptotic functions of caspase-8 as a driver of severe COVID-19 through modulation of inflammation, not through the induction of apoptosis. During SARS-CoV-2 infection caspase-8 fuels harmful inflammation independent of apoptosis. Genetic loss of caspase-8 reduces cytokine levels, lowers viral load and mitigates disease severity, revealing non-apoptotic caspase-8 as a key driver of severe COVID-19.",

Here, to obtain broader insights into this producer taxon, we conduct a comparative analysis on eight sponges through metagenomic and single-bacterial sequencing and biochemical studies. The data suggest sets of biosynthetic genes that are largely unique in 14 ‘Entotheonella’ candidate species and a member of a sister lineage named ‘Candidatus Proxinella’. Four biosynthetic loci were linked in silico or experimentally to cytotoxins, antibiotics and the terpene cembrene A from corals. The results support widespread and diverse bacterial roles in the chemistry of sponges and aid the development of sustainable production methods for sponge-derived therapeutics.

            "abstract": "Gene flow between biological species is a common and often adaptive evolutionary phenomenon throughout the tree of life1–4. Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny. Deep learning methods identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked low recombination region in placental mammals that serves as both a barrier to gene flow in hybridizing lineages and an accurate phylogenomic marker.",

            "abstract": "Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behaviour and neural representations in vision tasks1,2. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do3,4, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref. 5), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems. Aligning foundation models with human judgments enables them to more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across various levels of visual abstraction, while additionally improving their generalization performance.",

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.

Earlier work suggested that shared architectural constraints were a major factor, but the success of widely varied architectures after pretraining raises critical questions about the importance of architectural constraints. Here we show that in wide networks with minimal training, architectural inductive biases have a prominent role. We examined networks with varied architectures but no pretraining and quantified their ability to predict image representations in the visual cortices of monkeys and humans. We found that cortex-aligned representations emerge in convolutional architectures that combine two key manipulations of dimensionality: compression in the spatial domain, through pooling, and expansion in the feature domain by increasing the number of channels. We further show that the inductive biases of convolutional architectures are critical for obtaining performance gains from feature expansion—dimensionality manipulations were relatively ineffective in other architectures and in convolutional models with targeted lesions. Our findings suggest that the architectural constraints of convolutional networks are sufficiently close to the constraints of biological vision to allow many aspects of cortical visual representation to emerge even before synaptic connections have been tuned through experience. Kazemian et al. report that untrained convolutional networks with wide layers predict primate visual cortex responses nearly as well as task-optimized networks, revealing how architectural constraints shape brain-like representations in deep networks.",

Here, to this end, we introduce SynGFN, which models molecular design as a cascade of simulated chemical reactions, enabling the assembly of molecules from synthesizable building blocks. SynGFN features two key ingredients: (1) a hierarchically pretrained policy network that accelerates learning across diverse distributions of desirable molecules in chemical spaces, and (2) a multifidelity acquisition framework to alleviate the cost of reward evaluations. These technical developments collectively endow SynGFN with the capability to explore a chemical space up to an order of magnitude larger (measured in terms of #Circles) than that of other synthesis-aware generative models, while identifying the most diverse, synthesizable and high-performance molecules. We demonstrate SynGFN’s potential impacts by designing inhibitors for GluN1/GluN3A, a therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders. A persistent gap from theoretical molecules to experimentally viable compounds has hindered the practical adoption of generative algorithms. This study proposes SynGFN as a bridge linking molecular design and synthesis, accelerating exploration and producing diverse, synthesizable, high-performance molecules.",

A central challenge has been to identify parameters of detailed biophysical models such that they match physiological measurements or perform computational tasks. Here we describe a framework for simulating biophysical models in neuroscience—Jaxley—which addresses this challenge. By making use of automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration, Jaxley enables optimizing large-scale biophysical models with gradient descent. Jaxley can learn biophysical neuron models to match voltage or two-photon calcium recordings, sometimes orders of magnitude more efficiently than previous methods. Jaxley also makes it possible to train biophysical neuron models to perform computational tasks. We train a recurrent neural network to perform working memory tasks, and a network of morphologically detailed neurons with 100,000 parameters to solve a computer vision task. Jaxley improves the ability to build large-scale data- or task-constrained biophysical models, creating opportunities for investigating the mechanisms underlying neural computations across multiple scales. Jaxley is a versatile platform for biophysical modeling in neuroscience. It allows efficiently simulating large-scale biophysical models on CPUs, GPUs and TPUs.

However, current approaches require sharing the covariance matrix between variants for each study and trait of interest. For large-scale studies with many phenotypes, these matrices can be cumbersome to calculate, store and share. Here, to address this challenge, we present REMETA—an efficient tool for meta-analysis of gene-based tests. REMETA uses a single sparse covariance reference file per study that is rescaled for each phenotype using single-variant summary statistics. We develop new methods for binary traits with case–control imbalance, and to estimate allele frequencies, genotype counts and effect sizes of burden tests. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our approach through meta-analysis of five traits in 469,376 samples in UK Biobank. The open-source REMETA software will facilitate meta-analysis across large-scale exome sequencing studies from diverse studies that cannot easily be combined.

Recent AI systems, often reliant on human data, typically lack the formal verification necessary to guarantee correctness. By contrast, formal languages such as Lean1 offer an interactive environment that grounds reasoning, and reinforcement learning (RL) provides a mechanism for learning in such environments. We present AlphaProof, an AlphaZero-inspired2 agent that learns to find formal proofs through RL by training on millions of auto-formalized problems. For the most difficult problems, it uses Test-Time RL, a method of generating and learning from millions of related problem variants at inference time to enable deep, problem-specific adaptation. AlphaProof substantially improves state-of-the-art results on historical mathematics competition problems. At the 2024 IMO competition, our AI system, with AlphaProof as its core reasoning engine, solved three out of the five non-geometry problems, including the competition’s most difficult problem. Combined with AlphaGeometry 23, this performance, achieved with multi-day computation, resulted in reaching a score equivalent to that of a silver medallist, marking the first time an AI system achieved any medal-level performance. Our work demonstrates that learning at scale from grounded experience produces agents with complex mathematical reasoning strategies, paving the way for a reliable AI tool in complex mathematical problem-solving.",

Although controlling stereogenic carbon1–3, silicon4,5, phosphorus6,7 and sulfur8,9 centres is commonplace, nitrogen centres in amines are not typically stable. Limited achievements in the enantioselective construction of nitrogen chirality have primarily been established in quaternary ammonium salts10–12 and bridged bicyclic amines13–17, which have a restricted pyramidal configuration. The asymmetric synthesis of non-bridged pyramidal nitrogen-chirogenic compounds suffers from a super-stoichiometric chiral source and exhibits poor stereoselectivity18–24. Here we present a catalytic enantioselective strategy for construction of acyclic nitrogen stereocentres via a chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed chlorination reaction. We designed a stereospecific intramolecular reaction to overcome the structural and configurational instabilities of nitrogen-chlorinated hydroxylamines. The resulting 2-alkoxy-1,2-oxazolidines showed good enantiopurities, and density functional theory calculations confirmed successful enantiocontrol of nitrogen chirality during the chlorination process. Furthermore, this strategy has been applied successfully to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre. Control experiments provide evidence for an SN2 pathway for the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution event. An asymmetric organocatalysis strategy is used to control pyramidal nitrogen chirality and to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre.",

            "abstract": "Chirality is central to life, and controlling the formation of one of a pair of mirror-image molecules (enantiomers) is a central tenet of synthetic chemistry. Although controlling stereogenic carbon1–3, silicon4,5, phosphorus6,7 and sulfur8,9 centres is commonplace, nitrogen centres in amines are not typically stable. Limited achievements in the enantioselective construction of nitrogen chirality have primarily been established in quaternary ammonium salts10–12 and bridged bicyclic amines13–17, which have a restricted pyramidal configuration. The asymmetric synthesis of non-bridged pyramidal nitrogen-chirogenic compounds suffers from a super-stoichiometric chiral source and exhibits poor stereoselectivity18–24. Here we present a catalytic enantioselective strategy for construction of acyclic nitrogen stereocentres via a chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed chlorination reaction. We designed a stereospecific intramolecular reaction to overcome the structural and configurational instabilities of nitrogen-chlorinated hydroxylamines. The resulting 2-alkoxy-1,2-oxazolidines showed good enantiopurities, and density functional theory calculations confirmed successful enantiocontrol of nitrogen chirality during the chlorination process. Furthermore, this strategy has been applied successfully to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre. Control experiments provide evidence for an SN2 pathway for the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution event. An asymmetric organocatalysis strategy is used to control pyramidal nitrogen chirality and to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre.",

            "abstract": "Florigen, encoded by FT genes, is synthesized in leaves and transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to induce flower development1–3. At the SAM, 14-3-3 proteins are proposed to act as receptors for FT protein and to mediate the indirect interaction between FT and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD to form the florigen activation complex (FAC) that activates transcription of flowering genes4–6. Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development. In flowering plants, DNA–FD–14-3-3 recruits FT to the florigen activation complex both through DNA–FT interactions and by reducing liquid phase condensation of FD protein, which promotes dimerization, leading to FT recruitment.",

Correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered by precise choice of stacking geometry1–3. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry4,5. An open question is how the atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. On above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of 0.6°, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons and correlation-driven behaviours. Femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers.",

By contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene stack densely and can exhibit molecular impermeability4–6. Solution-synthesized 2D polymers that exhibit the latter by poly-condensation have been a longstanding goal. Herein, we demonstrate self-supporting, spin-coated 2D polyaramid nanofilms that exhibit nitrogen permeability below 3.1 × 10−9 Barrer, nearly four orders of magnitude lower than every class of existing polymer, and similar for other gases tested (helium, argon, oxygen, methane and sulfur hexafluoride). Optical interference during the pressurization of nanofilm-coated microwells allows measurement of mechanosensitive rim opening and sealing, creating gas-filled bulges that are stable exceeding three years. This discovery enables 2D polymer resonators with high resonance frequencies (about 8 MHz) and quality factors up to 537, similar to graphene. A 60-nm coating of air-sensitive perovskites reduces the lattice degradation rate 14-fold with an oxygen permeability of 3.3 × 10−8 Barrer. Molecularly impermeable polymers promise the next generation of barriers that are synthetically processable, chemically amenable and maximize molecular rejection with minimal material, ultimately advancing sustainability goals. Two-dimensional polyaramid polymers are synthesized to form nanofilms that exhibit the lowest gas permeability of any polymer by orders of magnitude,&nbsp;despite lacking crystallinity, enabling molecular-scale nanomechanical resonators and barrier materials.",

In addition, the ability to capture spatial information of kinase activity is crucial to deconvolute complex signaling networks, interrogate multifaceted kinase actions, and assess drug effects or genetic perturbations.

ProKAS is based on a tandem array of peptide sensors with amino acid barcodes that allow multiplexed analysis for spatial, kinetic, and screening applications. We engineered a ProKAS module to simultaneously monitor the activities of the DNA damage response kinases ATR, ATM, and CHK1 in response to genotoxic drugs, while also uncovering differences between these signaling responses in the nucleus, cytosol, and replication factories. Furthermore, we developed an in silico approach for the rational design of specific substrate peptides expandable to other kinases. Overall, ProKAS is a versatile system for systematically and spatially probing kinase action in cells.

Despite these advances, the compartmentalized approach to computer-aided molecular design and synthesis remains a critical bottleneck, limiting further optimization of the design–make–test–analyze cycle. Here, to this end, we introduce SynGFN, which models molecular design as a cascade of simulated chemical reactions, enabling the assembly of molecules from synthesizable building blocks. SynGFN features two key ingredients: (1) a hierarchically pretrained policy network that accelerates learning across diverse distributions of desirable molecules in chemical spaces, and (2) a multifidelity acquisition framework to alleviate the cost of reward evaluations. These technical developments collectively endow SynGFN with the capability to explore a chemical space up to an order of magnitude larger (measured in terms of #Circles) than that of other synthesis-aware generative models, while identifying the most diverse, synthesizable and high-performance molecules. We demonstrate SynGFN’s potential impacts by designing inhibitors for GluN1/GluN3A, a therapeutic target for neuropsychiatric disorders. A persistent gap from theoretical molecules to experimentally viable compounds has hindered the practical adoption of generative algorithms. This study proposes SynGFN as a bridge linking molecular design and synthesis, accelerating exploration and producing diverse, synthesizable, high-performance molecules.",

It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults2, and is associated with several severe outcomes3–11. Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified12,13, but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes (MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2; P &lt; 3.07 × 10−6; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk&nbsp;genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD (n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes. An analysis of rare genetic variants identifies three genes—MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2—that have a role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and investigates the potential underlying biological mechanisms.",

The molecular mechanisms that prevent regeneration of neurons in the CNS remain largely unknown1,2. Here, to address the intracellular response to injury, we developed an in situ cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy platform to mimic axonal damage and present the structural mechanism underlying thalamic axon regeneration induced by the drug epothilone B. We observed that stabilized microtubules extend beyond the injury site, generating membrane tension and driving membrane expansion. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the&nbsp;in situ structure of microtubules at 3.19 Å resolution,&nbsp;which engage epothilone B within the microtubule lattice at the regenerating front. During repair, tubulin clusters are delivered and incorporated into polymerizing microtubules at the regenerating site. These microtubule shoots serve as scaffolds for various types of vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the supply of materials necessary for axon repair until membrane tension normalizes. We demonstrate the unexpected ability of neuronal cells to adjust to strain induced by epothilone B, which creates homeostatic imbalances and activates axons to regeneration mode. A&nbsp;combined cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy pipeline&nbsp;was developed to inflict axonal damage and monitor the cellular response induced by epothilone B, revealing that microtubule polymerization at and beyond the lesion site promote axon regeneration.",

However, a missing tool is one that can locate proteins in tissues in an untargeted manner at high spatial resolution and coverage. Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications. Isotropic tissue magnification is integrated with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to enable untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution and with high protein identification rates in multiple tissue types.",

However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do3,4, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref. 5), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems. Aligning foundation models with human judgments enables them to more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across various levels of visual abstraction, while additionally improving their generalization performance.",

Earlier work suggested that shared architectural constraints were a major factor, but the success of widely varied architectures after pretraining raises critical questions about the importance of architectural constraints. Here we show that in wide networks with minimal training, architectural inductive biases have a prominent role. We examined networks with varied architectures but no pretraining and quantified their ability to predict image representations in the visual cortices of monkeys and humans. We found that cortex-aligned representations emerge in convolutional architectures that combine two key manipulations of dimensionality: compression in the spatial domain, through pooling, and expansion in the feature domain by increasing the number of channels. We further show that the inductive biases of convolutional architectures are critical for obtaining performance gains from feature expansion—dimensionality manipulations were relatively ineffective in other architectures and in convolutional models with targeted lesions. Our findings suggest that the architectural constraints of convolutional networks are sufficiently close to the constraints of biological vision to allow many aspects of cortical visual representation to emerge even before synaptic connections have been tuned through experience. Kazemian et al. report that untrained convolutional networks with wide layers predict primate visual cortex responses nearly as well as task-optimized networks, revealing how architectural constraints shape brain-like representations in deep networks.",

We show that for the Poisson equation, a fundamental PDE in science and engineering, our neural circuit achieves meaningful levels of numerical accuracy and close to ideal scaling on modern, inherently parallel and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware, specifically Intel’s Loihi 2 neuromorphic platform. We illustrate extensions to irregular mesh geometries in both two and three dimensions as well as other PDEs such as linear elasticity. Our spiking neural network is constructed from a recurrent network model of the brain’s motor cortex and, in contrast to black-box deep artificial neural network-based methods for PDEs, directly translates the well-understood and trusted mathematics of the FEM to a natively spiking neuromorphic algorithm. Theilman and Aimone introduce a natively spiking algorithm for solving partial differential equations on large-scale neuromorphic computers and demonstrate the algorithm on Intel’s Loihi 2 neuromorphic research chip.",

An appropriately placed stimulus in the AFP produces a blood oxygenation level-dependent response that peaks during the initial high temporal signal-to-noise ratio phase of the acquisition block. Using humans and monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) at different field strengths, we demonstrate up to a ~50% reduction in the number of trials needed to achieve a given statistical threshold relative to conventional fMRI.

During repair, tubulin clusters are delivered and incorporated into polymerizing microtubules at the regenerating site. These microtubule shoots serve as scaffolds for various types of vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the supply of materials necessary for axon repair until membrane tension normalizes. We demonstrate the unexpected ability of neuronal cells to adjust to strain induced by epothilone B, which creates homeostatic imbalances and activates axons to regeneration mode.

Correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered by precise choice of stacking geometry1–3. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry4,5. An open question is how the atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. On above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of 0.6°, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons and correlation-driven behaviours. Femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers.",

By contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene stack densely and can exhibit molecular impermeability4–6. Solution-synthesized 2D polymers that exhibit the latter by poly-condensation have been a longstanding goal. Herein, we demonstrate self-supporting, spin-coated 2D polyaramid nanofilms that exhibit nitrogen permeability below 3.1 × 10−9 Barrer, nearly four orders of magnitude lower than every class of existing polymer, and similar for other gases tested (helium, argon, oxygen, methane and sulfur hexafluoride). Optical interference during the pressurization of nanofilm-coated microwells allows measurement of mechanosensitive rim opening and sealing, creating gas-filled bulges that are stable exceeding three years. This discovery enables 2D polymer resonators with high resonance frequencies (about 8 MHz) and quality factors up to 537, similar to graphene. A 60-nm coating of air-sensitive perovskites reduces the lattice degradation rate 14-fold with an oxygen permeability of 3.3 × 10−8 Barrer. Molecularly impermeable polymers promise the next generation of barriers that are synthetically processable, chemically amenable and maximize molecular rejection with minimal material, ultimately advancing sustainability goals.

            "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells maintain homeostasis of their outer membrane by controlled internalization of lipid and protein constituents via endocytosis. Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and uses similarly folded domains. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes, however, differs between eukaryotic kingdoms. The TPLATE complex (TPC) in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several protein domains with a conserved role in endocytosis into a single octameric protein complex. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation and requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPC of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane-binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences. Finally, we demonstrate via molecular dynamics simulations that the crescent shape of the structured part of the complex is sufficient for membrane curvature generation. Our mechanistic insight, obtained by a combined biochemical and computational approach, shows that the structured part of the TPC likely contributes to the execution of plant endocytosis, which does not depend on cytoskeletal-based force generation. The manuscript uses an integrative approach to generate a comprehensive structure of the multisubunit endocytic TPLATE complex and to study its membrane targeting and its role in membrane deformation during the initial phase of plant endocytosis.",

Hence, cryo-EM holds the potential of a very sensitive analytical method for delivering high-resolution protein structure as a readout. In practice, millions of times more starting biological material is required to prepare cryo-EM grids. Here we show that using a micro isolation (MISO) method, which combines microfluidics-based protein purification with cryo-EM grid preparation, cryo-EM structures of soluble bacterial and eukaryotic membrane proteins can be solved starting from less than 1 µg of a target protein and progressing from cells to cryo-EM grids within a few hours. This scales down the amount of starting biological material hundreds to thousands of times, opening possibilities for the structural characterization of hitherto inaccessible proteins.

CAB-OLST enables high-throughput, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise ratio volumetric imaging, achieving an optical resolution of 0.77 μm × 0.49 μm × 2.61 μm. This allows for mouse brain-wide cell type distribution mapping at a voxel size of 0.37 μm × 0.37 μm × 1.77 μm in 10 h and single-neuron projectome imaging with a voxel size of 0.26 μm × 0.26 μm × 1.06 μm over 58 h. Compared to existing light-sheet and point-scanning systems, CAB-OLST provides a scalable and robust platform for comprehensive neuronal morphology reconstruction and high-precision cell atlas generation.

Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SLC37A4 in four functional states, capturing conformational transitions between lumen-facing and cytoplasm-facing states. Combined with mutational analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we identify a conserved substrate-binding pocket that alternately accommodates G6P and Pi through electrostatic complementarity and domain-dependent interactions. We further demonstrate that the high-affinity inhibitor S-4048 sterically occludes the cytoplasmic entry pathway by trapping the transporter in a cytoplasm-facing conformation.

However, their transport mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we elucidate the structural and functional basis of human solute carrier family 37 member 2 (SLC37A2), a G6P transporter implicated in metabolic regulation and macrophage inflammation. We show that SLC37A2 functions as a uniporter, facilitating G6P transport independent of inorganic phosphate gradients. Structures of SLC37A2 in the apo and G6P-bound states reveal a dimeric architecture. Both the ER luminal-open and cytosolic-open structures are captured, showing the structural dynamics during G6P transport. G6P is coordinated by SLC37A2 through interactions with its phosphate and hydroxyl groups. Furthermore, mapping mutations associated with glycogen storage disease type Ib onto SLC37A2 highlights residues essential for transport activity.

            "abstract": "Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity1–3. Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of cells in intestinal fistulae of patients with Crohn’s disease reveals the existence of specialized fistula-associated cell states with distinct signalling profiles and extracellular matrix architecture.",

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.

However, the contribution of rare non-coding variants to those differences remains poorly characterized. Here we analyse whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank2,3 to quantify the relative contribution of 40 million single-nucleotide and short indel variants (with a minor allele frequency (MAF) larger than 0.01%) to the heritability of 34 complex traits and diseases. On average across phenotypes, we find that WGS captures approximately 88% of the pedigree-based narrow sense heritability: that is, 20% from rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) and 68% from common variants (MAF ≥ 1%). We show that coding and non-coding genetic variants account for 21% and 79% of the&nbsp;rare-variant WGS-based heritability, respectively. We identified 15 traits with no significant difference between WGS-based and pedigree-based heritability estimates, suggesting their heritability is fully accounted for by&nbsp;WGS data. Finally, we performed genome-wide association analyses of all 34 phenotypes and, overall, identified 11,243 common-variant associations and 886 rare-variant associations. Altogether, our study provides high-precision estimates of rare-variant heritability, explains the heritability of many phenotypes and demonstrates for lipid traits that more than 25% of rare-variant heritability can be mapped to specific loci using fewer than 500,000 fully sequenced genomes.

Rapid urbanization is exposing larger and more vulnerable populations to flooding3, while climate change intensifies rainfall patterns4,5 and rising sea levels impair drainage systems6–11. Despite the growing recognition and urgency of these hazards, the health impacts of rainfall remain poorly understood, and those of sea-level rise are entirely unquantified. Here we estimate the mortality consequences of rainfall in one of the world’s largest cities—Mumbai, India. We integrate high-resolution data on rainfall, tides and mortality to analyse how unmanaged rainfall, and its interaction with tidal dynamics, contribute to urban health risks. We find that rainfall causes more than 8% of Mumbai’s deaths during the monsoon season, and that more than 80% of this burden is borne by slum residents. Children face the biggest increase in mortality risk from rainfall, and women face a greater risk than men. We also demonstrate that mortality risk from rainfall increases sharply during high tides and use this relationship to evaluate how rising sea levels could amplify rainfall-induced mortality in the absence of adaptation. Our findings reveal that the mortality impacts of rainfall are an order of magnitude larger than is documented by official statistics12,13, highlighting the urgent need for investment in improved drainage, sanitation and waste-management infrastructure. High-resolution rainfall, tide and mortaility data are used to quantify the impact of rainfall and flooding on urban health in Mumbai, India, revealing an order-of-magnitude discrepency between observed and officially reported mortality impacts, with slum residents bearing most of the burden.",

            "abstract": "Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies1. NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis2,3, but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases. CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide screening shows that SIGLEC12 mediates plasma membrane rupture in cells undergoing necroptosis, possibly through a human-specific mechanism, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target.",

Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015&nbsp;(refs. 1,2), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention.

Studying more homogeneous groups stratified according to clinical characteristics, such as age of onset, can improve the identification of the underlying genetic causes and lead to more targeted treatment strategies. We leveraged Nordic biobanks with longitudinal health registries to investigate differences in the genetic architectures of early-onset (eoMDD; n = 46,708 cases) and late-onset (loMDD; n = 37,168 cases) MDD. We identified 12 genomic loci for eoMDD and two for loMDD. Overall, the two MDD subtypes correlated moderately (genetic correlation, rg = 0.58) and differed in their genetic correlations with related traits. These findings suggest that eoMDD and loMDD have partially distinct genetic signatures, with a specific developmental brain signature for eoMDD. Importantly, we demonstrate that polygenic risk scores (PRS) for eoMDD predict suicide attempts within the first 10 years after the initial diagnosis: the absolute risk for suicide attempt was 26% in the top PRS decile, compared to 12% and 20% in the bottom decile and the intermediate group, respectively. Taken together, our findings can inform precision psychiatry approaches for MDD.

While programmed cell death is known to drive inflammation, its role in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remains unclear. Using gene-targeted murine COVID-19 models, we here find that caspase-8 is critical for cytokine release and inflammation. Loss of caspase-8 reduces disease severity and viral load in mice, and this occurs independently of its apoptotic function. Instead, reduction in SARS-CoV-2 pathology is linked to decreased IL-1β levels and inflammation. Loss of pyroptosis and necroptosis mediators in gene-targeted animals provides no additional benefits in mitigating disease outcomes beyond that conferred by loss of caspase-8. Spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of caspase-8-deficient mice confirm that improved outcomes are due to reduced pro-inflammatory responses, rather than changes in cell death signalling. Elevated expression of caspase-8 and cFLIP in infected lungs, alongside caspase-8-mediated cleavage of N4BP1, a suppressor of NF-kB signalling, indicates a role of this signalling axis in pathological inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight non-apoptotic functions of caspase-8 as a driver of severe COVID-19 through modulation of inflammation, not through the induction of apoptosis. During SARS-CoV-2 infection caspase-8 fuels harmful inflammation independent of apoptosis. Genetic loss of caspase-8 reduces cytokine levels, lowers viral load and mitigates disease severity, revealing non-apoptotic caspase-8 as a key driver of severe COVID-19.",

However, the contribution of rare non-coding variants to those differences remains poorly characterized. Here we analyse whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank2,3 to quantify the relative contribution of 40 million single-nucleotide and short indel variants (with a minor allele frequency (MAF) larger than 0.01%) to the heritability of 34 complex traits and diseases. On average across phenotypes, we find that WGS captures approximately 88% of the pedigree-based narrow sense heritability: that is, 20% from rare variants (MAF &lt; 1%) and 68% from common variants (MAF ≥ 1%). We show that coding and non-coding genetic variants account for 21% and 79% of the&nbsp;rare-variant WGS-based heritability, respectively. We identified 15 traits with no significant difference between WGS-based and pedigree-based heritability estimates, suggesting their heritability is fully accounted for by&nbsp;WGS data. Finally, we performed genome-wide association analyses of all 34 phenotypes and, overall, identified 11,243 common-variant associations and 886 rare-variant associations. Altogether, our study provides high-precision estimates of rare-variant heritability, explains the heritability of many phenotypes and demonstrates for lipid traits that more than 25% of rare-variant heritability can be mapped to specific loci using fewer than 500,000 fully sequenced genomes. WGS data were used from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry&nbsp;in the UK Biobank to obtain high-precision&nbsp;estimates of&nbsp;coding and non-coding rare&nbsp;variant heritability for 34 complex traits and diseases.",

Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny. Deep learning methods identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked low recombination region in placental mammals that serves as both a barrier to gene flow in hybridizing lineages and an accurate phylogenomic marker.",

In recent years, rapid progress has been made in rare disease diagnostics due to advances in next-generation sequencing, development of new computational and functional genomics approaches to prioritize genes and variants and increased global sharing of clinical and genetic data. However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative. Here we describe the collaborative research framework, datasets and discoveries comprising GREGoR that will provide foundational resources and substrates for the future of rare disease genomics.

It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults2, and is associated with several severe outcomes3–11. Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified12,13, but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes (MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2; P &lt; 3.07 × 10−6; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk&nbsp;genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD (n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes. An analysis of rare genetic variants identifies three genes—MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2—that have a role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and investigates the potential underlying biological mechanisms.",

These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems. Comparisons of 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and outgroups have been used to reconstruct ancestral adaptation to life on land across 11 distinct terrestrialization events, revealing strong evidence for convergent genomic evolution across the animal kingdom and recurring periods of terrestrial colonization.",

NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis2,3, but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases. CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide screening shows that SIGLEC12 mediates plasma membrane rupture in cells undergoing necroptosis, possibly through a human-specific mechanism, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target.",

Studying more homogeneous groups stratified according to clinical characteristics, such as age of onset, can improve the identification of the underlying genetic causes and lead to more targeted treatment strategies. We leveraged Nordic biobanks with longitudinal health registries to investigate differences in the genetic architectures of early-onset (eoMDD; n = 46,708 cases) and late-onset (loMDD; n = 37,168 cases) MDD. We identified 12 genomic loci for eoMDD and two for loMDD. Overall, the two MDD subtypes correlated moderately (genetic correlation, rg = 0.58) and differed in their genetic correlations with related traits. These findings suggest that eoMDD and loMDD have partially distinct genetic signatures, with a specific developmental brain signature for eoMDD. Importantly, we demonstrate that polygenic risk scores (PRS) for eoMDD predict suicide attempts within the first 10 years after the initial diagnosis: the absolute risk for suicide attempt was 26% in the top PRS decile, compared to 12% and 20% in the bottom decile and the intermediate group, respectively. Taken together, our findings can inform precision psychiatry approaches for MDD.

However, current approaches require sharing the covariance matrix between variants for each study and trait of interest. For large-scale studies with many phenotypes, these matrices can be cumbersome to calculate, store and share. Here, to address this challenge, we present REMETA—an efficient tool for meta-analysis of gene-based tests. REMETA uses a single sparse covariance reference file per study that is rescaled for each phenotype using single-variant summary statistics. We develop new methods for binary traits with case–control imbalance, and to estimate allele frequencies, genotype counts and effect sizes of burden tests. We demonstrate the performance and advantages of our approach through meta-analysis of five traits in 469,376 samples in UK Biobank. The open-source REMETA software will facilitate meta-analysis across large-scale exome sequencing studies from diverse studies that cannot easily be combined. REMETA is a method for meta-analyzing gene-based associations using summary statistics, integrating with REGENIE and improving computational efficiency for large studies with many phenotypes.",

UMBS-seq outperforms conventional bisulfite and enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq) methods in library yield, complexity, and conversion efficiency when applied to low-input DNA samples. In particular, its effectiveness with low-input cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and hybridization-based target capture highlights its potential for clinical applications, including 5mC biomarker detection and early disease diagnosis. DNA methylation is a critical biomarker for disease detection, yet current methods often compromise DNA integrity or lack sufficient accuracy.

            "abstract": "Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity1–3. Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease. Spatial transcriptomic analysis of cells in intestinal fistulae of patients with Crohn’s disease reveals the existence of specialized fistula-associated cell states with distinct signalling profiles and extracellular matrix architecture.",

However, a missing tool is one that can locate proteins in tissues in an untargeted manner at high spatial resolution and coverage. Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications. Isotropic tissue magnification is integrated with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to enable untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution and with high protein identification rates in multiple tissue types.",

We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development. In flowering plants, DNA–FD–14-3-3 recruits FT to the florigen activation complex both through DNA–FT interactions and by reducing liquid phase condensation of FD protein, which promotes dimerization, leading to FT recruitment.",

Gymnosperms, the oldest living seed plants, are an untapped genomic reservoir for genes involved in seed evolution. To tap this resource, we assemble deep transcriptomes of 14 gymnosperms, four angiosperms, and two ferns and identified 22,429 phylogenetically informative ortholog groups. We observe that genes differentially expressed in ovules or leaves provide the majority of phylogenomic support for the evolutionary splits between 1) seed and non-seed plants; 2) gymnosperms and angiosperms; and/or 3) within gymnosperms (conifers vs. “ancient” gymnosperms). Our gymnosperm data identifies unreported candidate ovule regulated genes in Arabidopsis. Moreover, prior knowledge from Arabidopsis helps uncover 4,076 candidate ovule genes that influence these evolutionary splits. We validate the expression of candidate ovule genes in gymnosperm-specific ovule structures. Our work provides a resource for seed gene discovery, conservation, and crop improvement.

In plant shoots, PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1)-mediated polar auxin transport instructs periodic formation of auxin maxima, which develop into lateral organs or leaf serrations. However, it remains unknown how the intervals of regularly arising auxin maxima are controlled. Here we show that a cysteine rich peptide EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE 2 (EPFL2) dose-dependently determines the intervals of auxin maxima during serration formation in leaf primordia. EPFL2 constitutes a mutually repressive relationship with cellular auxin response, thereby produces bistable states. Based on our computational simulations, we propose that the bistability modulates the periodicity of PIN1-mediated auxin maxima formation. Moreover, EPFL2 ensures precise phyllotactic angles, underscoring the general role of EPFL2 in auxin-mediated shoot patterning. This study illustrates that the intercoupling between EPFL2-auxin bistable module and PIN1-mediated polar auxin transport underpins versatile periodicity in auxin maxima formation during shoot development. Plant development is characterized by periodic morphogenesis, yet regulatory mechanisms underlying the periodicity remain unknown.

Endocytosis is evolutionary conserved and uses similarly folded domains. How these structural folds are combined into proteins and protein complexes, however, differs between eukaryotic kingdoms. The TPLATE complex (TPC) in plants is an evolutionary ancient protein module that combines several protein domains with a conserved role in endocytosis into a single octameric protein complex. Its molecular architecture, lipid-nucleated condensate formation and requirement for clathrin cage curvature revealed its function in endocytosis initiation in plants. Mechanistic understanding of how this complex drives membrane deformation during plant endocytosis is, however, lacking. Here we used an integrative structural approach to obtain a precise molecular structure of the TPC of Arabidopsis thaliana. In addition, our approach allowed visualizing the structural flexibility that hallmarks this enigmatic complex. We prove that the intrinsic structural flexibility is required for its functionality and membrane recruitment. The membrane-binding interface consists of several domains with differential lipid preferences. Finally, we demonstrate via molecular dynamics simulations that the crescent shape of the structured part of the complex is sufficient for membrane curvature generation. Our mechanistic insight, obtained by a combined biochemical and computational approach, shows that the structured part of the TPC likely contributes to the execution of plant endocytosis, which does not depend on cytoskeletal-based force generation. The manuscript uses an integrative approach to generate a comprehensive structure of the multisubunit endocytic TPLATE complex and to study its membrane targeting and its role in membrane deformation during the initial phase of plant endocytosis.",

            "abstract": "PcG complexes are pivotal in orchestrating the transition from embryonic to vegetative development in plants. However, the mechanisms underlying the gene expression reprogramming that takes place during this developmental transition are still not fully understood. Several studies suggest that incorporating PcG modifications into distinct histone variants may play a key role in this process. However, while PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 is essential for gene repression, the timing of PRC2 action on canonical H3.1 or variant H3.3 remains unclear. Furthermore, the exact role of PRC1 in transcriptional regulation is still unresolved, partly owing to limited knowledge of the conditions under which this complex monoubiquitinates canonical H2A or H2A.Z variant. Here, we demonstrate that H2A.Z undergoes monoubiquitination during the seed-to-seedling transition. H2A.Zub facilitates the recruitment of PRC2 to mediate H3.3 trimethylation, repressing seed-specific genes; however, H2A.Zub also promotes the activation of vegetative-specific genes by preventing H3K27me1 incorporation into H3.1. Notably, the histone demethylase REF6 initiates this process by removing two methyl groups from stably repressed H3.1K27me3-marked genes, enabling the subsequent H2A.Zub incorporation. This result suggests that REF6 activity is a critical early step in PRC1-mediated transcriptional activation. Our findings reveal the long-sought mechanism by which PRC1 participates in transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that PRC1-mediated H2A.Zub, acting as a “switcher”, plays a pivotal role in reprogramming active and repressed genes during the transition from embryonic to vegetative development. Moreover, our results provide new insights into the intricate relationship between histone modifications and histone variants in reprogramming and maintaining gene expression patterns.",

At the SAM, 14-3-3 proteins are proposed to act as receptors for FT protein and to mediate the indirect interaction between FT and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD to form the florigen activation complex (FAC) that activates transcription of flowering genes4–6. Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development. In flowering plants, DNA–FD–14-3-3 recruits FT to the florigen activation complex both through DNA–FT interactions and by reducing liquid phase condensation of FD protein, which promotes dimerization, leading to FT recruitment.",

It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults2, and is associated with several severe outcomes3–11. Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified12,13, but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes (MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2; P &lt; 3.07 × 10−6; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk&nbsp;genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD (n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes. An analysis of rare genetic variants identifies three genes—MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2—that have a role in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and investigates the potential underlying biological mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Rules behind the spatial arrangement of repetitive modules are key principles of multicellular morphogenesis. In plant shoots, PIN-FORMED 1 (PIN1)-mediated polar auxin transport instructs periodic formation of auxin maxima, which develop into lateral organs or leaf serrations. However, it remains unknown how the intervals of regularly arising auxin maxima are controlled. Here we show that a cysteine rich peptide EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR-LIKE 2 (EPFL2) dose-dependently determines the intervals of auxin maxima during serration formation in leaf primordia. EPFL2 constitutes a mutually repressive relationship with cellular auxin response, thereby produces bistable states. Based on our computational simulations, we propose that the bistability modulates the periodicity of PIN1-mediated auxin maxima formation. Moreover, EPFL2 ensures precise phyllotactic angles, underscoring the general role of EPFL2 in auxin-mediated shoot patterning. This study illustrates that the intercoupling between EPFL2-auxin bistable module and PIN1-mediated polar auxin transport underpins versatile periodicity in auxin maxima formation during shoot development. Plant development is characterized by periodic morphogenesis, yet regulatory mechanisms underlying the periodicity remain unknown. Tameshige et al. reveal that bistable cellular status modulates the spatial pattern of periodic leaf morphogenesis.",

            "abstract": "PcG complexes are pivotal in orchestrating the transition from embryonic to vegetative development in plants. However, the mechanisms underlying the gene expression reprogramming that takes place during this developmental transition are still not fully understood. Several studies suggest that incorporating PcG modifications into distinct histone variants may play a key role in this process. However, while PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 is essential for gene repression, the timing of PRC2 action on canonical H3.1 or variant H3.3 remains unclear. Furthermore, the exact role of PRC1 in transcriptional regulation is still unresolved, partly owing to limited knowledge of the conditions under which this complex monoubiquitinates canonical H2A or H2A.Z variant. Here, we demonstrate that H2A.Z undergoes monoubiquitination during the seed-to-seedling transition. H2A.Zub facilitates the recruitment of PRC2 to mediate H3.3 trimethylation, repressing seed-specific genes; however, H2A.Zub also promotes the activation of vegetative-specific genes by preventing H3K27me1 incorporation into H3.1. Notably, the histone demethylase REF6 initiates this process by removing two methyl groups from stably repressed H3.1K27me3-marked genes, enabling the subsequent H2A.Zub incorporation. This result suggests that REF6 activity is a critical early step in PRC1-mediated transcriptional activation. Our findings reveal the long-sought mechanism by which PRC1 participates in transcriptional activation. We demonstrate that PRC1-mediated H2A.Zub, acting as a “switcher”, plays a pivotal role in reprogramming active and repressed genes during the transition from embryonic to vegetative development. Moreover, our results provide new insights into the intricate relationship between histone modifications and histone variants in reprogramming and maintaining gene expression patterns.",

            "abstract": "The synthesis of enantiopure materials is vital for pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries owing to the inherently chiral nature of biological systems and the fact that two enantiomers can have markedly different biochemical properties1. In particular, enantioselective preparation of atropisomers is of great interest owing to their privileged status as chiral ligands and pharmacophores2–4. Although chromatographic- or crystallization-based methods are commonly used to separate atropisomers, we urgently need more efficient and economical approaches to access enantioenriched atropisomers5,6. The use of stereoconvergent methods to access molecules with point chirality is well established but we have not tapped the potential of stereoconvergent catalytic methods to arrive at enantioenriched atropisomers. Here we report deracemization activity of a P450 enzyme and explore its ability to deliver a stereoconvergent route towards enantioenriched atropisomers. Using a curated set of P450 variants, we found that a wide variety of symmetric and non-symmetrically substituted 2,2′-binaphthol (BINOL) building blocks can be deracemized to high enantiomeric purity. This deracemization activity is mechanistically distinct from the activity of previously reported P450 enzymes, which operate through enantioselective bond formation to afford enantioenriched atropisomers. By contrast, the deracemization process reported here is proposed to proceed through bond rotation. As engineered variants have complementary selectivity profiles and substrate scope, this biocatalytic platform should be readily tunable for any desired substitution pattern. We anticipate that these results will inspire new stereoconvergent approaches to synthesizing conformationally stable atropisomers. A new method for deracemization of atropisomers is described which leverages a P450 enzyme-mediated process involving bond rotation for enantioenrichment.",

Using off-the-shelf optics, we combine an air objective and a meniscus lens with an axially swept light sheet to achieve diffraction-limited resolution and aberration correction. The effective field of view is increased by twofold by correcting the field curvature of the light sheet using a concave mirror in the remote focusing unit. Adapting the light sheet’s motion with a closed-loop feedback enhances the imaging speed by tenfold, reaching 100 frames per second while maintaining resolution and field of view. We benchmark the system performance across scales, from subcellular structure up to centimeter scale, using various clearing methods.

This corresponds to picograms of purified protein, which can potentially be isolated from a few thousand cells. Hence, cryo-EM holds the potential of a very sensitive analytical method for delivering high-resolution protein structure as a readout. In practice, millions of times more starting biological material is required to prepare cryo-EM grids. Here we show that using a micro isolation (MISO) method, which combines microfluidics-based protein purification with cryo-EM grid preparation, cryo-EM structures of soluble bacterial and eukaryotic membrane proteins can be solved starting from less than 1 µg of a target protein and progressing from cells to cryo-EM grids within a few hours. This scales down the amount of starting biological material hundreds to thousands of times, opening possibilities for the structural characterization of hitherto inaccessible proteins.

However, current imaging methods are limited by throughput, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, constraining their broader applicability. Here, we present confocal Airy beam integrated with single-photon oblique light-sheet tomography (CAB-OLST): a system that integrates single-photon excitation with a scanned Airy beam light sheet, virtual slit detection and automated mechanical sectioning. CAB-OLST enables high-throughput, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise ratio volumetric imaging, achieving an optical resolution of 0.77 μm × 0.49 μm × 2.61 μm. This allows for mouse brain-wide cell type distribution mapping at a voxel size of 0.37 μm × 0.37 μm × 1.77 μm in 10 h and single-neuron projectome imaging with a voxel size of 0.26 μm × 0.26 μm × 1.06 μm over 58 h. Compared to existing light-sheet and point-scanning systems, CAB-OLST provides a scalable and robust platform for comprehensive neuronal morphology reconstruction and high-precision cell atlas generation.

Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny. Deep learning methods identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked low recombination region in placental mammals that serves as both a barrier to gene flow in hybridizing lineages and an accurate phylogenomic marker.",

These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems. Comparisons of 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and outgroups have been used to reconstruct ancestral adaptation to life on land across 11 distinct terrestrialization events, revealing strong evidence for convergent genomic evolution across the animal kingdom and recurring periods of terrestrial colonization.",

Gymnosperms, the oldest living seed plants, are an untapped genomic reservoir for genes involved in seed evolution. To tap this resource, we assemble deep transcriptomes of 14 gymnosperms, four angiosperms, and two ferns and identified 22,429 phylogenetically informative ortholog groups. We observe that genes differentially expressed in ovules or leaves provide the majority of phylogenomic support for the evolutionary splits between 1) seed and non-seed plants; 2) gymnosperms and angiosperms; and/or 3) within gymnosperms (conifers vs. “ancient” gymnosperms). Our gymnosperm data identifies unreported candidate ovule regulated genes in Arabidopsis. Moreover, prior knowledge from Arabidopsis helps uncover 4,076 candidate ovule genes that influence these evolutionary splits. We validate the expression of candidate ovule genes in gymnosperm-specific ovule structures. Our work provides a resource for seed gene discovery, conservation, and crop improvement.

Here we find that mitophagy is triggered after a&nbsp;reduction in&nbsp;cytosolic AcCoA levels through short-term fasting and through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase (encoded by ACLY), mitochondrial citrate/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A1) or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (encoded by ACSS2), and the mitophagy can be counteracted by acetate supplementation. Notably, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member X1 (NLRX1) mediates this effect. Disrupting NLRX1 abolishes cytosolic AcCoA reduction-induced mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the mitochondria outer-membrane-localized NLRX1 directly binds to cytosolic AcCoA within a conserved pocket on its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, AcCoA binds to the LRR domain and enhances its interaction with the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which helps to maintain NLRX1 in an autoinhibited state and prevents the association between NLRX1 and light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, we find that the AcCoA–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance. Thus, cytosolic AcCoA is a signalling metabolite that connects metabolism to mitophagy through its receptor NLRX1. Acetyl-coenzyme A functions as a non-canonical signal to trigger mitophagy, and&nbsp;the acetyl-coenzyme A–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance.",

Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit1–5. One such gene is nblA, which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6–8. Under nutrient deprivation cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9–11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light-harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation6,8,13. However, the benefit of the virus-encoded NblA for cyanophages and the broader impact on the host are unclear. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that viral NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and comprise 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of NblA to the cyanophage, while it exerts a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA has an adverse global impact on light harvesting by oceanic picocyanobacteria. Viral NblA accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency.",

Here, we investigate iron absorption, losses, and the efficacy and safety of oral iron supplementation with versus without prebiotics in three prospective studies in children with virally suppressed HIV in South Africa (NCT03572010, NCT04931641). In the first study, using stable iron isotopes, we show that iron absorption from iron-fortified maize porridge, a lipid-based nutrient supplement, and an oral iron supplement is comparable between children with HIV (n = 43) and without HIV (n = 45). In the second study, we use a stable iron isotope dilution method over a 6-month period to demonstrate that children with HIV (n = 29) absorb significantly less iron from their habitual diet than their uninfected peers (n = 36), while basal iron losses are similar. In the third study, a 12-week randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, iron-deficient children with HIV receiving iron with prebiotic galacto-oligosaccharides (n = 41) exhibit a 39% greater relative increase in serum ferritin (primary outcome) compared to those receiving iron with placebo (n = 42) (p = 0.053). They also report significantly fewer infection-related symptoms, with no significant differences in gut inflammation or enteropathogen carriage (secondary outcomes). Collectively, these findings indicate that while dietary iron absorption is reduced in children with virally suppressed HIV, supplemental and fortificant iron are well absorbed, and co-administration of iron supplements with prebiotics may improve efficacy and safety. Children living with HIV face a heightened risk of iron deficiency, yet optimal prevention and treatment strategies remain elusive. In these three prospective studies in South African children living with HIV, the authors show reduced dietary iron absorption but adequate absorption from iron supplements.

However, regulation of nucleotide metabolism remains incompletely understood. Here, we reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Using uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we show that coenzyme Q (CoQ) is dispensable for pyrimidine synthesis, in the presence of the demethoxy-CoQ intermediate as alternative electron acceptor. We further report that the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT5 directly binds PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis, which inhibits its activity and preserves the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool. In the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis exhausts the PRPP pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, which promotes resistance to purine and pyrimidine nucleobase analogues. Of note, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT is disrupted by PRPP, highlighting an intricate allosteric regulation. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism of nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a regulator of nucleobase analogue metabolism. A uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies demethoxy-CoQ as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of CoQ, and NUDT5 as a regulator of de novo pyrimidine synthesis via its interaction with PPAT.",

Despite its central role in glycogen metabolism and immune regulation, the structural mechanisms governing SLC37A4’s transport cycle and pathological dysfunction remain elusive. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of human SLC37A4 in four functional states, capturing conformational transitions between lumen-facing and cytoplasm-facing states. Combined with mutational analysis, molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we identify a conserved substrate-binding pocket that alternately accommodates G6P and Pi through electrostatic complementarity and domain-dependent interactions. We further demonstrate that the high-affinity inhibitor S-4048 sterically occludes the cytoplasmic entry pathway by trapping the transporter in a cytoplasm-facing conformation.

Here we find that mitophagy is triggered after a&nbsp;reduction in&nbsp;cytosolic AcCoA levels through short-term fasting and through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase (encoded by ACLY), mitochondrial citrate/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A1) or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (encoded by ACSS2), and the mitophagy can be counteracted by acetate supplementation. Notably, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member X1 (NLRX1) mediates this effect. Disrupting NLRX1 abolishes cytosolic AcCoA reduction-induced mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the mitochondria outer-membrane-localized NLRX1 directly binds to cytosolic AcCoA within a conserved pocket on its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, AcCoA binds to the LRR domain and enhances its interaction with the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which helps to maintain NLRX1 in an autoinhibited state and prevents the association between NLRX1 and light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, we find that the AcCoA–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance. Thus, cytosolic AcCoA is a signalling metabolite that connects metabolism to mitophagy through its receptor NLRX1. Acetyl-coenzyme A functions as a non-canonical signal to trigger mitophagy, and&nbsp;the acetyl-coenzyme A–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance.",

However, regulation of nucleotide metabolism remains incompletely understood. Here, we reveal regulators of de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Using uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we show that coenzyme Q (CoQ) is dispensable for pyrimidine synthesis, in the presence of the demethoxy-CoQ intermediate as alternative electron acceptor. We further report that the ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase NUDT5 directly binds PPAT, the rate-limiting enzyme in purine synthesis, which inhibits its activity and preserves the phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) pool. In the absence of NUDT5, hyperactive purine synthesis exhausts the PRPP pool at the expense of pyrimidine synthesis, which promotes resistance to purine and pyrimidine nucleobase analogues. Of note, the interaction between NUDT5 and PPAT is disrupted by PRPP, highlighting an intricate allosteric regulation. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental mechanism of nucleotide balance and position NUDT5 as a regulator of nucleobase analogue metabolism. A uridine-sensitized CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies demethoxy-CoQ as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of CoQ, and NUDT5 as a regulator of de novo pyrimidine synthesis via its interaction with PPAT.",

            "abstract": "Skeletal muscle wasting is a defining feature of cancer cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome that drastically compromises patient quality of life and treatment outcomes. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to skeletal muscle wasting in cancer cachexia, yet the upstream molecular drivers remain elusive. Here we show that cancer impairs the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and of its transcriptional effector CREB1 in skeletal muscle, ultimately contributing to the downregulation of a core transcriptional network that supports mitochondrial integrity and function. The restoration of cAMP–PKA–CREB1 signalling through pharmacological inhibition of the cAMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) rescues the expression of mitochondrial-related genes, improves mitochondrial function and mitigates skeletal muscle wasting in male mice. Altogether, our data identify tumour-induced suppression of the cAMP–PKA–CREB1 axis as a central mechanism contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia. Furthermore, these findings highlight PDE4, particularly the PDE4D isoform, as a potential therapeutic target to preserve muscle mitochondrial function and counteract muscle wasting in cancer cachexia. Tumour-induced dysregulation of cAMP–PKA–CREB1 signalling in skeletal muscle is shown to be a driver of mitochondrial dysfunction, contributing to cancer cachexia in mice.",

However, a missing tool is one that can locate proteins in tissues in an untargeted manner at high spatial resolution and coverage. Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications. Isotropic tissue magnification is integrated with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to enable untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution and with high protein identification rates in multiple tissue types.",

Using off-the-shelf optics, we combine an air objective and a meniscus lens with an axially swept light sheet to achieve diffraction-limited resolution and aberration correction. The effective field of view is increased by twofold by correcting the field curvature of the light sheet using a concave mirror in the remote focusing unit. Adapting the light sheet’s motion with a closed-loop feedback enhances the imaging speed by tenfold, reaching 100 frames per second while maintaining resolution and field of view. We benchmark the system performance across scales, from subcellular structure up to centimeter scale, using various clearing methods.

We introduce ToxPredictor, a toxicogenomics framework combining RNA-seq data from primary human hepatocytes with pharmacokinetic data to predict dose-resolved DILI risks and safety margins. At its core is DILImap, an RNA-seq library tailored for DILI research, comprising 300 compounds at multiple concentrations. ToxPredictor achieves 88% sensitivity at 100% specificity in blind validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. It flagged recent phase III clinical failures, including Evobrutinib, TAK-875, and BMS-986142, overlooked by animal studies. Beyond prediction, ToxPredictor provides mechanistic insights into hepatotoxic pathways, enabling early de-risking and actionable safety decisions. Unlike single-endpoint readouts—even from 3D models—transcriptomics offers a multi-dimensional system-level view of hepatocyte responses, capable of detecting diverse DILI mechanisms not captured by conventional assays. Scalable, actionable, and integrated into a broader AI/ML drug discovery platform, this work establishes toxicogenomics as a promising tool for developing safer therapeutics and addressing one of the most pressing challenges in toxicology.

UMBS-seq outperforms conventional bisulfite and enzymatic methyl-sequencing (EM-seq) methods in library yield, complexity, and conversion efficiency when applied to low-input DNA samples. In particular, its effectiveness with low-input cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and hybridization-based target capture highlights its potential for clinical applications, including 5mC biomarker detection and early disease diagnosis. DNA methylation is a critical biomarker for disease detection, yet current methods often compromise DNA integrity or lack sufficient accuracy. Here, the authors introduce Ultra-Mild Bisulfite Sequencing, a technique that enables highly sensitive, robust, and accurate detection of 5mC.",

For some of the compounds, symbiotic bacteria have been established as the actual producers. Among the known sponge symbionts, ‘Candidatus Entotheonella’ members stand out because of their abundant and variable biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Here, to obtain broader insights into this producer taxon, we conduct a comparative analysis on eight sponges through metagenomic and single-bacterial sequencing and biochemical studies. The data suggest sets of biosynthetic genes that are largely unique in 14 ‘Entotheonella’ candidate species and a member of a sister lineage named ‘Candidatus Proxinella’. Four biosynthetic loci were linked in silico or experimentally to cytotoxins, antibiotics and the terpene cembrene A from corals. The results support widespread and diverse bacterial roles in the chemistry of sponges and aid the development of sustainable production methods for sponge-derived therapeutics. Marine sponges host bacteria that produce diverse bioactive compounds. Here, the authors conduct a large-scale metagenomic, single-bacterial and biochemical study to reveal the untapped biosynthetic potential of ‘Entotheonella’ symbionts, a talented producer taxon from microbial dark matter.",

This corresponds to picograms of purified protein, which can potentially be isolated from a few thousand cells. Hence, cryo-EM holds the potential of a very sensitive analytical method for delivering high-resolution protein structure as a readout. In practice, millions of times more starting biological material is required to prepare cryo-EM grids. Here we show that using a micro isolation (MISO) method, which combines microfluidics-based protein purification with cryo-EM grid preparation, cryo-EM structures of soluble bacterial and eukaryotic membrane proteins can be solved starting from less than 1 µg of a target protein and progressing from cells to cryo-EM grids within a few hours. This scales down the amount of starting biological material hundreds to thousands of times, opening possibilities for the structural characterization of hitherto inaccessible proteins.
